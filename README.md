# SAS Employee Hub

Modern, SharePoint-inspired employee portal prototype for SAS Retail. The single-page web app provides tabbed navigation across core resource categories with a polished blue-gray corporate theme.

## Features
- Responsive layout with hero banner, sticky navigation, and tabbed content.
- Cards, search demo, and preview areas tailored to New Hire, Docs, Travel, and Policies hubs.
- Accessible keyboard/tab navigation and semantic markup to ease future expansion.
- Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for easy deployment to GitHub Pages or static hosts.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:puploki93/SAS_Retail-Info.git`
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to explore the prototype locally.
3. Adjust placeholder copy, icons, and button actions to point at live assets when available.

### Project Structure
```
SASretail/
├── index.html     # Main application shell with tabbed sections
├── styles.css     # Styling, layout, and responsive design rules
└── script.js      # Navigation and simple demo interactions
```

## Deployment
The repository is ready for GitHub Pages or any static hosting platform. Publish by serving `index.html` and the accompanying assets at the site root.

To update the live site:
1. Make your changes locally.
2. Commit with a descriptive message.
3. Push to `main`: `git push origin main`

## Roadmap Ideas
- Upload workflow for documents and travel receipts.
- Role-based dashboards (Supervisor, Operations) and personalization.
- Authentication integration for access control, employee profiles, and approvals.
- Replace icons with branded artwork and embed live documents/videos.
