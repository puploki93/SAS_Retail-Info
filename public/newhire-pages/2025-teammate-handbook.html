INTRODUCTION
Important Notice About the ADV Teammate Handbook
The ADV Teammate Handbook (“Handbook”) contains information about employment policies and practices for
all Teammates of Advantage Solutions Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Advantage Solutions” or “the Company”) who
work in the United States. This Handbook is designed to acquaint you with Advantage Solutions and provide you
with information about working conditions, Teammate benefits and some of the policies affecting your
employment. You should read and understand the contents of this Handbook as you are required to remain in
compliance with all provisions. Failure to comply with the provisions of this Handbook may result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
Advantage Solutions operates in many locations and its Company policies may apply to Teammates working in a
state with greater or different rights. The Company complies not only with federal, but also with applicable state
and local laws. Please consult with Human Resources or review the State Supplements to this Handbook if you
have any questions concerning this Handbook, or how the state and local law requirements may differ from the
information presented here.
Except for the policy of at-will employment, the Company reserves the right to revise, modify, delete or add to
any policies, procedures, work rules, or benefits stated in this Handbook at any time. However, any such changes
must be in writing and signed by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company. Any changes to this
Handbook will be communicated to all Teammates in writing. No oral statements or representations can in any
way alter the provisions of this Handbook.
Nothing in this Handbook or in any other Company document or policy constitutes, or is intended to constitute,
an express or implied contract guaranteeing continued employment for any Teammate. No manager or supervisor
has any authority to enter into a contract of employment that changes the at-will employment relationship or
changes any of the provisions of this Handbook. Only the CEO of the Company has the authority to enter into an
employment agreement that alters the at-will employment relationship and any such agreement must be in
writing and must be signed by the CEO. Similarly, changes to this Handbook must be made by an official writing,
signed by the CEO.
Nothing in this Handbook or in any other document or policy is intended to violate any federal, state or local law.
Additionally, nothing in this Handbook is intended to limit any concerted activities by Teammates protected by
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act relating to their wages, hours or working conditions or any other
protected conduct. Furthermore, nothing in this Handbook prohibits a Teammate from reporting concerns, filing
a charge or complaint with, making lawful disclosures to, providing documents or other information to or
participating in an investigation or hearing conducted by any federal, state or local agency charged with
enforcement of any laws, or communicating with any governmental authority about conduct the Teammate
believes violates any laws or regulations.
This Handbook supersedes all previous versions of the Handbook issued by the Company and any inconsistent
verbal or written policy statements made or issued before this Handbook. Many matters covered by this
Handbook are also described in separate official documents. While they should be consistent, if there is any
difference, the official policies will prevail. Official policies and this Handbook will also prevail over any conflicting
representations and/or statements made by supervisors or managers. Please direct questions on any Handbook
or State Supplement policies to Human Resources.

EMPLOYMENT
At-Will Employment
While it is our hope that your employment with the Company will be mutually rewarding, it is important for you
to know that your employment with the Company is at-will, unless state law provides otherwise. This means that
your employment may be terminated at any time, with or without cause or notice, by you or by the Company.
Nothing contained in this Handbook, nor any oral statement or other document provided to the Teammate will
guarantee that employment will be continued for any length of time. This policy is the only agreement between
you and the Company as to the duration of employment and the circumstances under which employment may be
terminated. Only the CEO has the authority to enter into an agreement that alters the at-will relationship and then
only in writing.

Voluntary Open Door Policy
Open communication is essential to a successful work environment and helps foster a workplace built on integrity
and respect. All Teammates are encouraged to openly communicate their suggestions for improving the
workplace or any complaints about the workplace by using the following reporting channels. While these are not
the only avenues available to you, the Company believes that using these established methods of internal
communication can help foster prompt and effective resolution of workplace concerns.
•
•
•

Supervisor or Manager. This is your first contact. Your leaders are the ones who are the most familiar
with your work and are usually in the best position to resolve your issues and concerns.
Next Level Leader. This is your contact if you still have questions or concerns after meeting with your
supervisor or manager or if you are not comfortable contacting them. The next level leader would be the
person who your supervisor or manager reports to.
Human Resources. This is your contact if you are not comfortable contacting your supervisor/manager or
next level leader, if your concern was not adequately addressed by them, or if you would like to seek
further clarification. To reach Human Resources, please call 1-(888)-900-4276 or submit a ticket via
ServiceNow at https://advantageprod.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/esc.

The Ethics Hotline, found on the Company intranet, is the reporting method to be used for possible unethical or
illegal workplace concerns. To access the Ethics Hotline or learn more information about this avenue of reporting,
please visit EthicsPoint or call 888-325-7882. The hotline is operated by an independent third-party provider.
Reports may be anonymously submitted and will be investigated objectively, in a timely manner and as
confidentially as possible.
While we provide Teammates with these reporting channels to communicate their views, please understand that
not every complaint can be resolved to a Teammate’s satisfaction. Even so, we believe that open communication
is essential to a successful work environment and all Teammates should feel free to raise issues of concern without
fear of reprisal. The Company will not tolerate any retaliation against you by anyone for reporting an issue or
concern. If anyone is found to have engaged in retaliation against you, they may be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. By the same token, if a Teammate knowingly reports false
information; fails to cooperate in an investigation; or threatens any participants in an investigation, the Teammate
may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
Please remember that you may raise your concerns through any of the various reporting channels if you are not
comfortable using a particular channel, or if you believe your concerns have not been adequately addressed.

Equal Employment Opportunity
EEO/Non-Discrimination Policy. The Company is an equal opportunity employer and provides equal employment
opportunities without regard to age, ancestry, color, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming
practices), citizenship status, political activities or affiliations, status as a victim of domestic violence, assault or
stalking, disability (mental and physical), marital status, medical condition (cancer and genetic characteristics),
genetic information, military and veteran status, national origin (including language use restrictions), race, sex
(which includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth or
breastfeeding), gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, transgender status (including
whether or not you have transitioned or are transitioning), reproductive health decision-making or any other basis
protected by applicable law.
Equal employment opportunity applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including hiring, placement,
promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leave of absence, compensation and training.
Complaint Procedure. Any Teammate who believes that they have been harassed, discriminated against or
subject to retaliation by a co-worker, supervisor/manager, agent, client, vendor or customer of the Company, in
violation of the foregoing policies, or who is aware of such harassment, discrimination or retaliation against others,
should immediately provide a written or verbal report to their supervisor/manager, any other member of
management or Human Resources by calling (888)-900-4276 or submitting a ticket via ServiceNow at
https://advantageprod.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/esc or by accessing the Ethics
Hotline to report such incidents. To access the Ethics Hotline or to learn more information about this avenue of
reporting, please visit EthicsPoint or call 888-325-7882. After a report is received, Human Resources will conduct
a thorough and objective investigation. The investigation will be completed, and a determination made and
communicated to the Teammate as soon as practical. The Company requires that all Teammates will fully
cooperate with any investigation conducted by the Company into a complaint of prohibited harassment,
discrimination, retaliation, or alleged violation of any other Company policies, including by providing an interview
and/or a written statement.
If we determine that this policy has been violated, remedial action will be taken, commensurate with the severity
of the offense. Appropriate action will also be taken to deter any future harassment or discrimination prohibited
by this policy. If a complaint of prohibited harassment, discrimination or retaliation is substantiated, appropriate
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, will be taken.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and equivalent state agencies will accept and
investigate charges of unlawful discrimination, retaliation or harassment at no charge to the complaining party.
Protection Against Retaliation. Retaliation is prohibited against any person by another Teammate or by the
Company for using this complaint procedure, for reporting prohibited harassment or for filing, testifying, assisting
or participating in any manner in any investigation, proceeding or hearing conducted by a governmental
enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation includes, but is not limited to, termination, demotion, suspension,
failure to hire or consider for hire, failure to give equal consideration in making employment decisions, failure to
make employment recommendations impartially, adversely affecting working conditions or otherwise denying
any employment benefit.
A Teammate should report any retaliation prohibited by this policy to their supervisor/manager or Human
Resources. Any report of retaliatory conduct will be investigated in a thorough and objective manner. If retaliation
is found to have occurred, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, will be
taken.

Anti-harassment and Anti-discrimination
The Company is committed to providing a workplace free from unlawful harassment and discrimination of any
kind, including unlawful sexual harassment and harassment based on any characteristic protected by federal, state
or local laws. These protected characteristics include age, ancestry, color, religious creed (including religious dress
and grooming practices), denial of family and medical care leave, citizenship status, political activities or
affiliations, status as a victim of domestic violence, assault or stalking, disability (mental and physical), marital
status, medical condition (cancer and genetic characteristics), genetic information, military and veteran status,
national origin (including language use restrictions), race, sex (which includes pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding
and medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding), sexual orientation, gender, gender
identity, gender expression and transgender status (including whether or not you have transitioned or are
transitioning), making a complaint about harassment, discrimination or other unlawful conduct, participating in
an investigation of a complaint about harassment, discrimination or other unlawful conduct, or any other basis
protected by applicable law. For specific guidance, all Teammates must review, understand and comply with the
Company’s Sexual and Other Unlawful Harassment Policy located on the Company intranet.
The Company’s anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy applies to all persons involved in the operation of
the Company, including all Teammates of the Company, as well as vendors, customers, clients, interns and
consultants. If prohibited harassment occurs in the workplace by someone not employed by the Company, the
procedures in this policy should be followed. The workplace includes: actual worksites, any setting in which workrelated business is being conducted (whether during or after normal business hours), online and electronic
interactions with Company Teammates and third parties involved in our operations, Company-sponsored events,
and/or Company owned/controlled property.
Sexual harassment is illegal and includes unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or visual, verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
• Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of employment; or
• Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the
individual; or
• Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a Teammate's work performance
or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment, even if the individual making the
report is not the intended target of such conduct.
Prohibited sexual and other harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:
• Unwanted sexual advances or propositions (including repeated and unwelcome requests for dates).
• Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances.
• Visual conduct such as leering, making sexual gestures, displaying of sexually suggestive objects or
pictures, cartoons, posters, websites, emails or text messages.
• Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory jokes or comments, slurs or unwanted sexual advances,
invitations or comments about a Teammate’s body or dress, whistling or making suggestive or insulting
sounds.
• Verbal and/or written abuse of a sexual nature, graphic verbal and/or written sexually degrading
commentary about an individual's body or dress, sexually suggestive or obscene letters, notes, invitations,
emails, text messages, tweets or other social media postings.
• Physical conduct such as assault, touching, impeding or blocking normal movement.
• Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests as a condition of continued employment, or to avoid
some other loss and offers of employment benefits in return for sexual favors.
• Retaliation for reporting or threatening to report sexual or other harassment.

Page 10 of 11

Revised February 2025

Harassment on the basis of any legally protected status is prohibited, including harassment based on: age (40 and
over), national origin or ancestry, color, religion, citizenship status, physical or mental disability, medical condition,
marital status, genetic information (including testing and characteristics), veteran status, uniformed
servicemember status, race, sex (which includes pregnancy, lactation, childbirth or related medical conditions),
gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, transgender status (including whether or not you
have transitioned or are transitioning), or any other status protected by federal, state or local law. Prohibited
harassment may include behavior similar to the illustrations above pertaining to sexual harassment. It also
includes, but is not limited to:
• Verbal conduct including taunting, jokes, threats, epithets, derogatory comments or slurs based on an
individual’s protected status;
• Visual and/or written conduct including derogatory posters, photographs, calendars, cartoons, drawings,
websites, emails, text messages or gestures based on an individual’s protected status; and
• Physical conduct including assault, unwanted touching or blocking normal movement because of an
individual’s protected status.
Complaint Procedure. Any candidate, Teammate or intern who believes that they have been subjected to
prohibited harassment or retaliation by a co-worker, supervisor, manager, client, visitor, vendor, customer or
temporary or seasonal worker of the Company, or who believes another individual has been subject to such
conduct, should report it immediately. Candidates, Teammates or interns are encouraged to report concerns,
even if they relate to incidents in the past, involve individuals who are no longer affiliated with the Company, or
concern conduct occurring outside of work if it impacts the individual at work. Complaints can be made verbally,
or in writing, to the highest-ranking on-site supervisor or manager, any member of management or Human
Resources at (888)-900-4276 or submitting a ticket via ServiceNow at https://advantageprod.servicenow.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/esc. You may also contact the Company’s Ethics Line at 888-3257882 or online at www.adv.ethicspoint.com. Teammates are not required to report any prohibited conduct to a
supervisor or manager who may be hostile, who has engaged in such conduct, who is a close Teammate of the
person who has engaged in such conduct, or with whom the Teammate is uncomfortable discussing such matters.
Teammates are encouraged, but not required, to communicate to the offending person that their conduct is
offensive and unwelcome. Any supervisor or manager who receives a complaint of harassment or retaliation must
immediately report the matter to Human Resources.
If you experience, hear of, or witness any kind of unlawful discrimination or harassment, or retaliation of any kind,
immediately inform your supervisor/manager or Human Resources. The Company will immediately undertake a
thorough, objective investigation. Details of the investigation will be kept as confidential by the Company as
possible to the extent practical and permitted by law. The investigation will be completed, and a determination
made and communicated to the Teammate as soon as practical. If a complaint of prohibited harassment or
discrimination is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment,
will be taken. If a complaint cannot be substantiated, the Company may take appropriate action to reinforce its
commitment to providing a work environment free from harassment or discrimination.
While the Company’s intent is to resolve issues internally through the internal complaint procedure, you also
should be aware that the EEOC, as well as other state specific agencies, investigate complaints of prohibited
harassment in employment. If you think you have been harassed or retaliated against for resisting or complaining
about harassment or discrimination, you may file a complaint with the appropriate agency by visiting its website.
Supervisor/Manager’s Responsibility. All supervisors and managers are responsible for:
• Implementing this policy, which includes, but is not limited to, taking steps to prevent harassment and
retaliation;
• Ensuring that all Teammates under their supervision have knowledge of and understand this policy;
• Promptly reporting any complaints to the designated Human Resources Representative so they may be
Page 11 of 12

•
•

investigated and resolved in a timely manner;
Taking and/or assisting in prompt and appropriate corrective action when necessary to ensure compliance
with this policy; and
Conducting themselves, at all times, in a manner consistent with this policy.

Failure to meet these responsibilities may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment.
Protection Against Retaliation. Retaliation is prohibited against any person by another Teammate or by the
Company for using this complaint procedure, reporting prohibited harassment, objecting to such conduct or filing,
testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in any investigation, proceeding or hearing conducted by a
governmental enforcement agency. Prohibited retaliation includes, but is not limited to, termination, demotion,
suspension, failure to hire or consider for hire, failure to give equal consideration in making employment decisions,
failure to make employment recommendations impartially, adversely affecting working conditions or otherwise
denying any employment benefit.
Individuals who believe they have been subjected to retaliation or believe that another individual has been
subjected to retaliation, should report this concern to a supervisor or manager or to Human Resources. Any report
of retaliatory conduct will be investigated in a thorough and objective manner. If a report of retaliation prohibited
by this policy is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment,
will be taken. If a complaint cannot be substantiated, the Company may take appropriate action to reinforce its
commitment to providing a work environment free from retaliation.
Even if the alleged harassment or retaliation cannot be substantiated or does not turn out to rise to the level of a
violation of law, the initiation of a good faith complaint of harassment or retaliation will not be grounds for
disciplinary action. However, any individual who makes a complaint that is demonstrated to be intentionally false
may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
Corrective Action/Discipline. Any Teammate found to be responsible for harassment or other prohibited conduct
will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
In addition to being subject to discipline for engaging in harassing or sexually harassing conduct themselves,
supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline (up to and including termination) for failing to report
suspected harassment or sexual harassment, or otherwise knowingly allowing harassment or sexual harassment
to continue. Supervisors and managers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in prohibited retaliation.
The Company will strive to assist anyone who has been subjected to unwelcome harassment or retaliation to feel
more comfortable in the work environment. Such assistance may, but does not necessarily include, transfer or
reassignment. Any such assistance is at the Company’s sole discretion.

Business Ethics and Conduct
The successful business operation and reputation of the Company is built on the principles of fair dealing and
ethical conduct of our Teammates. The continued success of the Company is dependent upon the trust of our
customers, clients and vendors. Teammates have an obligation to the Company and its customers, clients and
vendors to act in a way that will preserve that trust and merit the continued trust and confidence of the public.
In general, good judgment, based on strong legal and ethical principles, will guide you with respect to acceptable
conduct. For specific guidance, all Teammates are expected to review, understand and comply with the Company’s
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Teammates should discuss any situation in which the proper course of action
Page 12 of 13

Revised February 2025

is unclear with their supervisor/manager, next level of management or Human Resources. Disregarding or failing
to comply with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may lead to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination of employment. Actual or suspected violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
can be made verbally, or in writing, to the highest-ranking on-site supervisor or manager, any member of
management, legal, or internal audit. You may also contact the Company’s Ethics Line at 888-325-7882 or online
at www.adv.ethicspoint.com.

Immigration Law Compliance
The Company is committed to employing only individuals who are legally authorized to work in the United States
and who comply with applicable immigration and employment laws. As a condition of employment, each new
Teammate must properly complete, sign and date the first section of the USCIS Form I-9 and present
documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility within three (3) business days of beginning
employment. If the Teammate cannot verify their right to work in the United States as required, the Company will
be required to terminate their employment immediately.

Disability and Accommodation
The Company is committed to compliance with applicable laws ensuring equal employment opportunities to
individuals with disabilities. The Company will make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or
mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is a candidate or a Teammate, unless
undue hardship and/or a direct threat to the health and/or safety of the individual or others would result. Any
Teammate who requires an accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of their job, enjoy an
equal employment opportunity and/or obtain equal job benefits may submit a request online on the Workplace
Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net. Human Resources will communicate
with the Teammate and engage in an interactive process to determine the nature of the issue and what, if any,
reasonable accommodation(s) may be appropriate. In some cases, this interactive process may be triggered
without a request from the Teammate, such as when the Company receives notice from its own observation or
another source that a medical impairment may be impacting the Teammate’s ability to perform their essential job
functions.
Teammates who believe they need an accommodation must specify what barriers or limitations prompted the
request. The Company will evaluate information obtained from the Teammate, and possibly their personal health
care provider or another appropriate health care provider, regarding any reported or apparent barrier(s) or
limitation(s) and will then work with the Teammate to identify possible accommodations, if any, that will help to
eliminate or otherwise address the barrier(s) or limitation(s). If an identified accommodation is reasonable and
will not impose an undue hardship on the Company and/or a direct threat to the health and/or safety of the
individual or others, the Company will generally make the accommodation, or it may propose another alternative
reasonable accommodation which may also be effective. Teammates are required to cooperate with this process
by providing all necessary documentation supporting the need for accommodation and be willing to consider
alternative reasonable accommodations when applicable.
Teammates who wish to request unpaid time away from work because of a qualifying disability should speak to
Human Resources regarding a proposed reasonable accommodation. Teammates may also request a workplace
accommodation through the Workplace Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at
AdvantageBenefits.net or via ServiceNow.

Religious Accommodation
The Company will provide reasonable accommodation for Teammates’ religious beliefs, observances and practices
when a need for such accommodation is identified and reasonable accommodation is possible. A reasonable
Page 13 of 14

Revised February 2025

accommodation is one that eliminates the conflict between a Teammate’s religious beliefs, observances, or
practices and the Teammate’s job requirements, without causing undue hardship to the Company.
The Company has developed an accommodation process to assist Teammates, management and Human
Resources. Through this process, the Company establishes a system of open communication between Teammates
and the Company to discuss conflicts between religion and work and to take action to provide reasonable
accommodation for Teammates’ needs. The intent of this process is to ensure a consistent approach when
addressing religious accommodation requests. Any Teammate who perceives a conflict between job requirements
and any religious belief, observance, or practice should present the conflict and their request for accommodation
to the attention of their manager or Human Resources or submit a request online on the Workplace
Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net.

Pregnancy Accommodation
The Company will not discriminate against a Teammate because they are pregnant or treat a Teammate that it
knows is pregnant differently from a non-pregnant person whose ability or inability to work is similar to that of
the pregnant Teammate. “Pregnancy” means “pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy
or childbirth, including recovery from childbirth.” Under the federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (“PWFA”), the
Company will make reasonable accommodations, including providing time off, for known physical or mental
limitations of Teammates related to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, unless the
accommodation would impose an undue hardship. “Known physical or mental limitations” are those that the
Teammate has communicated to the Company.
Teammates who wish to inform the Company of such a limitation and/or request a reasonable accommodation
should contact Human Resources in writing and specify what barriers or limitations prompted the request.
Teammates may also request a workplace accommodation through the Workplace Accommodations section on
Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net or by reaching out to Human Resources at (888)-900-4276 or via
ServiceNow. Human Resources will engage in an interactive process with the Teammate to determine the nature
of the limitation and what, if any, reasonable accommodation(s) may be appropriate. Documentation from a
health care provider supporting your need, duration, frequency and the nature of your work restrictions in
connection with your requested accommodation may be required as part of this process. Teammates are required
to cooperate with the Company in the interactive process.
Teammates who wish to request unpaid time away from work due to pregnancy should speak to Human Resources
regarding a proposed reasonable accommodation.

References/Verification of Employment
All requests for employment verification on behalf of a current or former Teammate are handled by the
Company’s third-party vendor. For questions, please reach out to Human Resources at (888)-900-4276 or via
ServiceNow.
So that the Company can handle requests for job references in a consistent, fair and lawful manner, all requests
for job references should be forwarded to the Company’s third-party vendor which will only confirm current or
former Teammates' dates of employment and job title.

Employment of Related Parties
Relations. The Company permits the employment of qualified family members and those occupying similar
personal relationships (“Relation”) only if the employment does not create a direct or indirect
supervisory/managerial relationship; does not involve the same reporting/management line; does not have the
Page 14 of 15

Revised February 2025

potential to and/or does not create an adverse impact on work performance or morale; and does not create an
actual or perceived conflict of interest. For purposes of this policy, “Relation” is defined as a parent, spouse, child,
sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, first cousin and corresponding in-law, “step”
relations and any member of the Teammate’s household.
Teammates are required to inform the Human Resources Compliance Team by emailing
hrcompliance@youradv.com if they are related to an employment candidate and candidates are required to
inform the Company if they are related to a current Teammate. If Teammates become related while employed
and a change in position is required to avoid workplace issues, the Company will attempt to make an
accommodation. If an accommodation is infeasible or impractical, the Teammates will be asked to determine who
will resign their employment. If the Teammates decline to decide, the Company will make the decision, in its sole
discretion.
Personal Relationships. A “personal relationship” is defined as a relationship between individuals who have a
relationship of a romantic or intimate nature. The Company respects the right of all individuals to develop and
engage in personal relationships of their own choice. The Company prohibits personal relationships between
Teammates if a direct or indirect supervisory/managerial relationship exists; involves the same
reporting/management line; or when their personal relationships may create a potential conflict of interest, cause
actual or perceived favoritism, or impact business judgment.
Any Teammate who is involved in a personal relationship which is a potential violation of this policy must
immediately inform their supervisor or manager or the Human Resources Compliance Team at
hrcompliance@youradv.com. The Company will evaluate the situation and work toward a resolution.
If it is determined that either a family or personal relationship violates Company policy, the Teammates will be
given the opportunity to discuss and decide who will transfer to another position, or be terminated, if no position
is available. If the Teammates decline to decide, the Company will make the decision, in its sole discretion.

Company Property and Teammate Privacy
Teammates may be provided with property that belongs to the Company or its clients or customers (“Company
Property”) to perform their job duties. Examples of Company Property include: computers, mobile phones, email
accounts, shared drives, desks, work areas, file cabinets, credenzas, debit/credit/expense cards, vehicles,
equipment, materials, financial assets, electronic or physical documents, access to software or other computer
programs, files and other information sent to, received by or generated by the Company, Teammates or others
acting on behalf of the Company.
Teammates shall have no expectation of privacy as to Company Property. To ensure the safety and security of
Teammates and customers, and to protect our legitimate business interests, the Company reserves the right, to
the furthest extent allowed by applicable law, to inspect and search all Company Property, even Company
Property provided to a Teammate for that Teammate’s sole use. Inspections may be conducted during or after
business hours, in the presence or absence of the Teammate.
Teammates may only access Company Property if they have been authorized to do so and only for its intended
purpose. Unauthorized or improper use, review, duplication, dissemination, removal, damage or alteration of
Company Property for personal or commercial gain is prohibited. Further, Teammates are to promptly report any
Company Property loss, damage, defect, misuse, or repair need to their supervisor/manager.
Upon termination of employment, or upon request at any time, Teammates are required to return Company
Property in satisfactory condition. Subject to applicable law, Teammates may be responsible for the reasonable
cost to repair or replace Company Property that is damaged, lost, stolen, or misused as a result of the Teammate’s
Page 15 of 16

Revised February 2025

gross negligence, willful misconduct, or failure to comply with Company policy or expectations. Additionally, in
these instances, Teammates may also be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment.

Personal Information Protection Policy
The Company is committed to safeguarding the privacy of its candidates and current and former Teammates.
Accordingly, the Company will take appropriate steps to ensure those interests are protected with respect to the
receipt, use, disclosure, transmission, storage and destruction of Personal Identifiable Information (“PII”) and
Confidential Teammate (or Applicant) Information (“CAI”). All Teammates are responsible for complying with the
following Company policy on PII and CAI.
Personal Identifiable Information is information that can be used to identify an individual. Any of the following,
in combination with an individual’s first name (or initial) and last name, is considered PII:
• Social Security or tax identification number
• Alien registration number
• Driver’s license number
• Passport number
• Federal or state-issued identification number
• Financial account number
• Credit or debit card number
• Health insurance policy or subscriber identification number
• Date of birth
• Other combination of the above data elements sufficient to identify an individual
Confidential Teammate (or Applicant) Information is any of the following, in combination with an individual’s
first name (or initial) and last name, or any of the above data elements, sufficient to identify an individual:
• Personal mailing/home address
• Personal home/residence phone number
• Personal mobile phone number
• Personal email address
• Precise geolocation of home and/or personal travel and destinations
• Company-issued Teammate identification numbers
• Medical records or information, including mental or physical health diagnosis

citizenship/immigration status
• Genetic or biometric data
PII and CAI should only be collected, used, stored and transmitted for legitimate business purposes. Teammates
in possession of PII or CAI should not disclose such information except: (1) as required to perform their job; (2) as
otherwise permitted or required by this policy or applicable law; or (3) as otherwise authorized or requested in
writing by the individual to whom the information relates.
Teammates who inadvertently receive or are provided access to PII or CAI for which there is no legitimate business
reason, are expected to: (1) promptly attempt to notify the sender of the inadvertent delivery, and if the sender
cannot be reached, notify Human Resources; (2) not disclose the information, except for the limited purpose of
complying with this policy; and (3) effectively destroy the information received.

Page 16 of 17

Revised February 2025

Any Teammate who fails to comply with their responsibilities as they relate to PII or CAI as set forth in this policy
may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
As a Company Teammate, you may have access to other information that people outside the Company never see
and to confidential information of third parties. “Confidential information” includes, but is not limited to: (a) the
identities, contact information, financial information, or other personal information of any of the Company’s
clients; (b) the Company’s advertising and marketing strategies, methods, research and related data; (c) the names
of any of the Company’s vendors or suppliers; (d) the cost, type and quantity of materials and/or supplies ordered
by the Company; (e) the prices at which the Company obtains or has obtained or sells or has sold its services; (f)
the Company’s costs, methods and objectives (including those methods licensed from other entities); (g) any
technical information owned or created by the Company or licensed from another entity; (h) any inventions,
techniques or proprietary methods; (i) any pending or issued patents; (j) financial or tax records; (k) any “trade
secrets” as such term is defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and applicable common law or any other
confidential information of, about, or concerning the business of the Company; and/or (l) such other confidential
information or data of any kind, nature, or description as may be designated as “Confidential” from time to time
by the Company.
All Confidential Information, no matter where or when obtained, must be kept confidential at all times and may
only be disclosed to those Teammates of the Company who are authorized to receive such information and who
also have a demonstrated need for such information. In addition to non-disclosure, you may not use confidential
information for personal profit or gain, or for any purpose outside your employment by the Company. The
Company, in turn, respects other companies’ proprietary and confidential information and requires Teammates
to treat such information with the same level of care and degree of privacy as they would the Company’s own
confidential and proprietary information.
This policy does not restrict or interfere with a Teammate’s rights under federal, state or local labor law. The
definition of “Confidential Information” does not include wages or a statutory Teammate’s terms and conditions
of employment. This policy is not intended to prohibit Teammates from discussing, disclosing and comparing
information regarding Teammate terms and conditions of employment, which include wages and working
conditions. To the extent any federal, state, or local laws for a Teammate’s primary work location impose
additional or more specific requirements with respect to protection of personal or confidential information, the
Company is committed to complying with such requirements. The Company will not terminate or otherwise
discriminate against Teammates because they make such inquiries, disclosures, comparisons or discussions about
their wages or the wages of another Teammate.
Moreover, this policy is not intended to restrict any rights that statutorily defined Teammates may have under
the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or other similar laws to discuss their wages and/or terms and conditions
of employment.

Access to Personnel Records
The Company maintains a personnel record on each Teammate. The personnel record includes such information
as the Teammate’s job application, resume, records of training, documentation of performance, salary increases
and other employment records.
Personnel records are the property of the Company and access to the information they contain is restricted.
Generally, only Human Resources and Company supervisors/managers with a legitimate reason to review
information may access the records. Disclosure of your personnel record to outside sources will be limited.
However, the Company will cooperate with official requests from authorized law enforcement or federal, state or
local agencies in the Teammate’s primary work location and as otherwise legally required.
Page 17 of 18

Revised February 2025

Teammates who wish to review their own records should submit a request form, available on the Human
Resources page on the Company intranet. Personnel records will be made available to Teammates or their
authorized representative, for review or copy, subject to applicable law, within a reasonable time frame from the
date the Company receives the Teammate’s written request and any required authorization. Teammates are also
encouraged to use self-service resources available on MyOracle to retrieve basic personnel-related information,
such as pay records, dates of hire, assignment details, etc.

Personal Data Changes
It is the responsibility of each Teammate to promptly notify the Company of any changes in personal data including
but not limited to mailing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, change in dependents, change in legal
name, emergency contacts, educational accomplishments and other such status reports. All personal data
changes should be submitted through MyOracle.

Additional Privacy Policies
For further information regarding the Company’s privacy practices, please refer to the “Legal Department” section
of the Company’s intranet site, as noted in the Key Resources at the end of this handbook. Under the “Data
Privacy” link you will find several privacy policies, including the Applicant Privacy Policy, Associate Privacy Policy,
and consumer-facing Privacy Policy.

EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND PRACTICES
Employment Classifications
Each Teammate is designated as either “non-exempt” or “exempt” according to federal and state wage law.
Teammates will be informed of their employment classification upon hire or change of classification. Teammates
who have questions regarding their classification should contact their supervisor/manager or Human Resources.
•
•

Exempt. Teammates classified as exempt are compensated on a salary basis and are not eligible for
overtime pay. Although actual hours may vary from time to time, such differences will not impact the
Teammate’s salary or benefits eligibility, subject to applicable law.
Non-exempt. Non-exempt Teammates usually work on an hourly basis and are eligible for overtime pay
for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a given week, or as otherwise required by applicable state law.

In addition to being classified as exempt or non-exempt, each Teammate is designated as Regular Full-Time,
Regular Part-Time, Temporary or Seasonal.
•
•

•

•

Regular Full-Time. Teammates classified as Regular Full-Time are normally scheduled to work 40 hours
per week. Full-time Teammates are generally eligible for the benefits described in this handbook and are
provided with benefits required by applicable law.
Regular Part-Time. Teammates classified as Regular Part-Time are normally scheduled to work less than
40 hours per week. (If a Teammate works more than 35 hours per week on occasion, such an infrequent
occurrence will not change their part-time classification). Part-time Teammates are eligible for some, but
not all benefits described in this handbook and are provided with benefits required by applicable law.
Temporary. Teammates classified as Temporary are generally hired to supplement the workforce or assist
with a specific project. It is the Company’s intention to limit the duration of Temporary assignments to a
maximum of ninety (90) days. Employment beyond this limit is allowed only if authorized by Human
Resources. Temporary Teammates are not eligible for benefits, except as required by applicable law.
Seasonal Teammates. Teammates classified as Seasonal are hired to work for a limited duration,
Page 18 of 19

Revised February 2025

according to seasonal periods, as defined by business needs. If a Seasonal Teammate has been inactive
and not working and not receiving wages for six months or more, their employment may be subject to
termination, other than where a Teammate is on an approved leave and in accordance with applicable
law. Seasonal Teammates are not eligible for benefits, except as required by applicable law.
General Points about Employment Classifications. The fact that “Regular” employment is not classified as
Temporary or Seasonal does not create a contract or guarantee of employment for any period of time or change
the at-will nature of a Teammate’s employment. Further, Temporary and Seasonal employment beyond any
initially stated period does not create a contract for or guarantee of employment for a specified period of time or
imply a change in at-will employment status.

Employment of a Minor
It is the policy of the Company to employ individuals who are at least 18 years of age. Any exception to this policy
requires the approval of the Chief Human Resources Officer. If an exception is granted, all state and/or federal
requirements must be met, which may include the following:
• Work permit for minors under 18 years of age unless they have a High School or GED diploma.
• Limitations on the number of hours a minor is permitted to work, per day and per week.
• Limitations on how early and how late in a day a minor is permitted to work.
• Assurance the minor will be working in a hazard-free work environment.

Job Duties
When you begin your employment with the Company, your manager will explain your job responsibilities and the
performance standards expected of you. The expectations of one’s job depends on one’s position and job duties
according to their job description or as otherwise communicated by management. Be aware that some or all of
your job responsibilities may be subject to change at any time during your employment. From time to time, you
may be asked to work on special projects, or to assist with other work necessary or important to the operation of
your department or the Company. Your cooperation and assistance in performing such additional work is
expected.
The Company reserves the right, at any time, with or without notice, to alter or change job responsibilities,
reassign or transfer job positions, or assign additional job responsibilities.

Teammate Benefits
Eligible Teammates and eligible dependents are provided a wide range of benefits. All Teammates receive
government-mandated benefit programs, such as Social Security, workers’ compensation, state disability and
unemployment insurance. Additional benefits are provided to Teammates according to their employment
classification, average hours worked, Company policy and terms and conditions of the benefit plans. Regular, FullTime Teammates are normally eligible for all benefits; Regular Part-Time Teammates are normally eligible for
some benefits; and Temporary and Seasonal Teammates are normally only eligible for those benefits mandated
by the applicable federal, state and local laws of their primary work location.
Some benefit programs require contributions from the Teammate, while others are fully paid by the Company.
Payment for benefits requiring contributions will usually be made through payroll deductions. A list of benefits
and eligibility information are provided to Teammates during the hiring process. A full description of benefits and
eligibility requirements are available on the Company intranet. Benefit plans offered by the Company are defined
in legal documents such as insurance contracts and summary plan descriptions. If there are inconsistencies
between the informal descriptions in this handbook and the actual plan descriptions, the actual plan descriptions
will govern. Plan documents, if applicable, are available for your inspection. The Company and its designated
Page 19 of 20

Revised February 2025

benefit plan administrators reserve the right to determine eligibility, interpretation and administration of issues
related to benefits offered by the Company.
The Company reserves the right to modify or eliminate any benefit programs and/or costs, subject to applicable
laws. If federal, state or local laws in a Teammate’s primary work location differ from the benefits outlined in the
handbook, the Company will comply with applicable laws to the extent it is required to do so.
Same-Sex Marriages, Civil Unions & Domestic Partnerships. The Company complies with all applicable federal
and state laws regarding the provision of benefits to same-sex spouses, domestic partners and couples in a civil
union. Teammates should contact HR Shared Services if they have any questions regarding benefits eligibility for
themselves or their spouses, domestic partners or partners in a civil union.

Background Check Policy
The Company recognizes the importance of maintaining a safe, secure workplace with Teammates who are
qualified, reliable and who do not present a serious risk of harm to their co-workers or others. To promote these
concerns and interests, the Company reserves the right to investigate an individual’s prior employment history,
personal references and educational background, as well as other relevant information. Consistent with legal or
contractual requirements, the Company also reserves the right to obtain and to review a candidate’s or a
Teammate’s criminal conviction record and related information, and to use such information when making
employment decisions, including hiring, placement, promotion, termination, recall, and transfer, but only to the
extent permissible under applicable law. A pending criminal matter may be considered in appropriate
circumstances for business-related reasons, consistent with applicable law. Please note that a background check
will be completed for all job positions with the Company. Additionally, all background checks will be conducted in
strict conformity with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, applicable state fair credit reporting laws and local,
state and federal anti-discrimination and privacy laws. The Company is an equal opportunity employer and will
comply with applicable federal, state and local laws relating To the use of background checks for employment
purposes.

Introductory Period
The first 90 days of continuous employment is considered an introductory period. While we are continuously
evaluating your performance and providing feedback regardless of your employment tenure, during this time your
supervisor/manager will monitor more closely your capabilities and work habits and evaluate if this new role is
the right role for you.
Teammates who are rehired, promoted or transferred within the Company must complete a 90-day introductory
period with each new assignment. Any absence will extend an introductory period by the length of the absence.
If the introductory period does not allow sufficient time to evaluate the Teammate’s performance, the
introductory period may be extended for a specified period.
Completion of the introductory period does not guarantee continued employment or change the at-will policy
that states the employment relationship may be terminated with or without cause and with or without advance
notice, at any time by you or the Company.

Job Posting
Job postings may be placed on the Company intranet to inform Teammates of current openings that may provide
an opportunity for potential advancement within the organization. Teammates are encouraged to talk with their
supervisors/managers about their career plans and apply for any open position, according to their skills and
experience. Teammates must be in good standing to apply for any open position within the Company. To indicate
Page 20 of 21

Revised February 2025

their interest in an opening for which they are qualified, Teammates should follow the guidelines found in this
handbook or on the Company intranet.
While the Company will attempt to fill open positions with qualified internal candidates, the Company reserves
the right, where permitted by law, to fill a position without posting the opening and/or by using any recruiting
source that is in the best interest of the Company.

Transfer Policy
The Company provides Teammates with a variety of ways to grow in their career and contribute to the growth
and value of the Company. Teammates are encouraged to explore transfer opportunities by viewing the
Company’s open positions on the Company intranet and by discussing career growth and development
opportunities with their supervisor/manager.
To help Teammates achieve their career goals, reasonable efforts will be made to post vacant positions and fill
them from within the organization. At the same time, in order to hire the most qualified candidate for the position,
the Company reserves the right to fill a position with someone outside the Company and without any job posting.
Unless transfer is part of a reasonable accommodation under applicable law, to be considered for a transfer, a
Teammate must have held their current position for at least six months, notify their current supervisor/manager
of intent to apply and be in good standing (i.e., meeting or exceeding performance expectations, following
Company policies, maintaining a positive attitude, no active disciplinary actions). If the Teammate is offered and
accepts the transfer, (1) the Teammate will promptly inform their current supervisor/manager; (2) the current
and new supervisor/manager will agree on a mutually convenient transfer date (generally in approximately two
weeks if possible); (3) the new supervisor/manager will inform the Teammate of the transfer date; and (4) the
current and new supervisor/manager will be responsible for processing the transfer.
Transfer to another position within the Company does not change the at-will employment relationship or create
a guarantee or contract of employment for any specific period of time, unless state law provides otherwise. If you
require transfer as a reasonable accommodation for a disability, pregnancy or as part of a religious observance,
please contact Human Resources.

Performance Reviews
Performance reviews provide an opportunity for regular full-time Teammates and supervisors/managers to
discuss current job performance, identify problems in the Teammate’s performance, identify individual work
objectives and goals, as well as possible career opportunities within the Company. Performance reviews will
generally be conducted at regular intervals, depending on the nature of the position, but supervisors/managers
and Teammates are strongly encouraged to informally discuss job performance and goals on a more frequent
basis.

Separation of Employment
The Company strives to ensure that Teammate terminations are handled fairly, efficiently and in compliance with
applicable laws. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following:
•

•

Voluntary Termination. A voluntary termination occurs when a Teammate makes the decision to end the
working relationship with the Company. Although not required based on the at-will nature of your
employment, Teammates who voluntarily terminate their employment are asked to provide their
supervisor/manager with at least two weeks' written notice.
Involuntary Termination. An involuntary termination occurs when the Company decides to end the working
Page 21 of 22

Revised February 2025

•

relationship with a Teammate.
Reduction in Force. Reductions in force generally occur if changes in business conditions create a need to
reduce the number of people employed.

Final wages will be paid in accordance with applicable law. Vacation, sick leave and floating holidays will not be
paid upon termination, unless otherwise required by the applicable state or local laws in a Teammate’s work
location. Some benefits may be continued at the Teammate’s expense if the Teammate so chooses. The
Teammate will be notified in writing of the benefits that may be continued and of the terms, conditions and
limitations of any such benefits.
Nothing in this policy is intended to limit or alter the at-will nature of your employment. Employment may be
terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, subject to applicable
law.

Flex Schedule/Telework
Regular full-time Teammates may request a flexible work arrangement (FWA), which is an intermediate or longterm change in the Teammate's regular working arrangement. There are two types of FWAs which Teammates
may request:
•
•

Flextime: Enables Teammates to vary their arrival and departure times from the standard hours, while
continuing to work during core hours and a standard-length day.
Telework: Enables Teammates to perform work that is traditionally performed in an office, at their home
or other off-site location.

A Teammate may request a FWA by presenting their supervisor/manager with a proposal that details the reason(s)
for the request and describes the anticipated effect on the business, the workflow, fellow Teammates, etc. The
Company will consider all FWA requests. However, it cannot approve requests or sustain previously approved
arrangements that are inconsistent with the Company's business operations or legal or contractual obligations.

Life Assistance and Work/Life Support Program
Teammates facing certain life challenges are encouraged to use the Company’s Life Assistance & Work/Life
Support Program. This program offers various solutions to help Teammates and their families find solutions and
restore peace of mind. Teammates will have access to over-the-phone support from trained advocates who can
help assess Teammate needs and develop a solution, along with access to behavioral counselors, educational
webinars, and legal and financial consultations. To access this service, call 800-344-9752 or visit the Advantage
Benefits page at AdvantageBenefits.net for more information.
The Company reserves the right to modify or cancel this program at any time, subject to any applicable laws.

Outside Employment
The Company respects each Teammate’s right to engage in activities outside of employment such as those that
are of a personal or private nature, to the extent that such activities do not create a conflict of interest as described
in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy or adversely affect the Teammate’s ability to perform
their job. Under certain circumstances, however, if a Teammate’s personal conduct adversely affects their
performance on the job or makes it impossible for them to carry out any or all of their job duties while at work,
appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, may be appropriate.
An example of an activity that might adversely affect a Teammate’s ability to perform their job duties is outside
Page 22 of 23

Revised February 2025

employment. While the Company does not prohibit Teammates from holding other jobs, the following types of
outside employment are generally prohibited (to the extent allowed under applicable law):
•
•
•
•

Employment that conflicts with the Teammate's work schedule, duties and responsibilities or creates an
actual conflict of interest;
Employment that impairs or has a detrimental effect on the Teammate's work performance with the
Company;
Employment that requires Teammates to conduct work or related activities during working times or use
any of the Company’s tools, materials, or equipment (including Company-provided internet or wireless
services); and
Employment that directly or indirectly competes with the business or the interests of the Company.

For the purposes of this policy, self-employment or consulting is considered outside employment. The Company
will not assume any responsibility for Teammates outside employment. Specifically, the Company will not provide
workers’ compensation coverage or any other benefit for injuries occurring from, or arising out of, such outside
employment.

PAY PRACTICES
Timekeeping/Payroll
The Company is committed to complying with all applicable timekeeping and wage payment laws and to properly
paying its Teammates. Below are some key timekeeping and payroll policies and procedures. This is not an
exhaustive list. Additionally, if any federal, state or local law in a Teammate's primary work location differs from
these policies and procedures, the Company will comply with such law to the extent it is required to do so.
If you have any questions regarding these policies, or those contained in any provided applicable state-specific
supplemental information (which is accessible on the Company intranet), or if you have a payroll question, contact
your supervisor, manager or HR Shared Services.
Failure to comply with the timekeeping and payroll expectations communicated in this document and/or any
additional requirements provided in applicable state-specific supplemental information (which is accessible on
the Company intranet), will lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment.
Non-Exempt Teammates
• Non-exempt Teammates are required to accurately, completely and personally record all time worked in
connection with their employment with the Company.
• All time worked will be paid at the Teammate’s designated wage rate, subject to minimum wage,
overtime, and other applicable federal, state and local laws.
• Off the clock work is NOT permitted. Working without recording time worked is strictly prohibited. No
one is permitted to work, or to require, suggest, encourage, or allow others to work off the clock.
• Teammates must accurately record the time they start and stop working (other than any paid rest periods
taken in accordance with applicable law). When a Teammate is clocked out, they may not perform any
work. By recording one’s work time, a Teammate affirms that they are not working when clocked out.
• Teammates are expected to promptly notify their supervisor/manager of any incorrect or missing time
entries by sending a written request with the corrected date/time and reasons for the correction.
Supervisors/managers will make the required change(s) through the timekeeping system.
• Making inaccurate time entries, omitting work time and requesting (or making) a dishonest adjustment
to time records are prohibited. Questions regarding the accuracy of time records or edits must be
Page 23 of 24

Revised February 2025

promptly directed to HR Shared Services.
Teammates will only be permitted to perform work outside of regular work hours if their direct
supervisor/manager expressly requests this in writing and if it is recorded as time worked.
• Teammates are expected to record their time entries at the time they start and end work and when they
start and end any applicable meal periods or split shifts. If a Teammate has any difficulty making entries
in the timekeeping system, they are expected to use an alternative method, as directed by their supervisor
or manager.
If you become aware that any supervisor or manager is requesting, encouraging, allowing or requiring that nonexempt Teammates work “off the clock,” that supervisor’s or manager’s conduct should be reported to Human
Resources. Such reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible. Retaliation against any Teammate who
reports a violation of this policy in good faith will not be tolerated. Any supervisor or manager who requests or
requires that non-exempt Teammates work “off the clock” or who retaliates against any Teammate(s) who reports
in good faith their belief that a supervisor or manager is requesting or requiring that non-exempt Teammates
work “off the clock” will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
•

Exempt Teammates
Exempt Teammates are paid on a salary basis. This means the Teammate regularly receives a predetermined
amount of compensation each pay period, which cannot be reduced because of variations in the quality or
quantity of the Teammate’s work. In general, an exempt Teammate will receive their salary for any week in which
they perform any work, regardless of the number of days or hours worked, except in the following circumstances:
•
•
•

If an exempt Teammate takes one or more full days off work for personal reasons other than sickness or
disability, the Teammate will not be paid for such day(s) of absence, but the Teammate may use available
vacation time to make up for the reduction in salary.
An exempt Teammate will be paid only for the days actually worked if the Teammate works only part of
the week during their first and last week with the Company.
An exempt Teammate will not be paid for days/hours of absence taken under unpaid leave pursuant to
the Family and Medical Leave Act or other applicable corresponding state or local laws.

The Company may require an exempt Teammate to use available vacation or sick time, as a replacement for salary,
when the Teammate takes less than a full day off from work, as permitted by applicable law.
An exempt Teammate’s salary will not be reduced when the Teammate works part of a week and misses part of
a week due to service as a juror, witness or in the military or for lack of work.
It is Company policy to comply with the salary basis requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and
applicable state law. The Company prohibits any deductions from pay that violate the FLSA or applicable state
law.
If an exempt Teammate believes that an improper deduction has been made, the Teammate should immediately
report this to their supervisor, manager, or Human Resources. Reports of improper deductions will be promptly
investigated. If it is determined that an improper deduction has occurred, the Teammate will be reimbursed for
any improper deduction made.

Meal and Rest Periods
It is the Company’s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding meal and rest
periods for non-exempt Teammates.
• If a Teammate works in a state with mandated meal and rest period requirements, the Company will
provide meals and rest periods in accordance with all applicable state requirements. Teammates and their
supervisors/managers are expected to review, understand, and comply with all applicable provisions in
Page 24 of 25

Revised February 2025

•
•
•

any applicable state-specific supplemental information (which is accessible on the Company intranet)
provided in connection with this Handbook.
If a Teammate works in a state where there are no applicable meal or rest period requirements, the
Company will provide break time as appropriate, subject to operational needs and supervisor/manager
discretion. The Company does not contract to provide such break time in these states.
Rest periods of short duration (between five and 20 minutes) provided to Teammates will be counted as
hours worked and paid accordingly. Teammates must be relieved of all duties during their rest periods;
however, as rest periods are paid time, Teammates should not clock out for rest periods.
Meal periods lasting 30 minutes or more provided to Teammates are not considered hours worked and
will not be paid. Teammates must be completely relieved from work duties during any unpaid meal period.
Teammates must record the beginning and ending time of their meal periods taken each day.

Please make sure to review your business unit’s specific meal and rest break policy for more details. If you have
questions on how to access the policy, please reach out directly to your manager or supervisor.
Nothing in this policy is intended to limit a Teammate’s ability to take required restroom breaks or legally
mandated breaks related to lactation or an approved reasonable accommodation related to one’s disability,
religion or pregnancy.
Any non-exempt Teammate who believes they were not provided meal or rest periods in keeping with this policy
or applicable law is expected to promptly notify Human Resources by calling (888)-900-4276 or submitting a ticket
via ServiceNow at https://advantageprod.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/esc. Teammates
may also submit a report through the Ethics Hotline at http://adv.ethicspoint.com or call 888-325-7882. If a
Teammate does not report any concerns, as directed, they are affirming that any missed, late, or short meal or
rest periods were a voluntary choice and not the result of being discouraged or prevented from taking those meal
or rest periods; and that they were permitted to take all meal and rest periods, in accordance with this policy and
applicable law.

Lactation Policy
Teammates who are nursing mothers may take reasonable breaks to express milk as frequently as needed, up to
the age required by applicable law. Although not required, the breaks should be taken concurrently with provided
break periods. For non-exempt Teammates, breaks are unpaid unless they run concurrently with a paid rest break
or as required by state law. For Teammates who do not work from home, the Company will identify designated
locations in its offices or other facilities and will work with third parties to identify designated private locations,
shielded from view, free from intrusion from co-workers and the public and separate from the restroom facilities
for this purpose. The Company will make a reasonable effort to identify a location within close proximity to the
work area for the Teammate to express milk. This location may be the Teammate’s or another private office, if
applicable.
Teammates will be relieved of all work-related duties during the lactation break. Where unpaid breaks or
additional time are required, Teammates should work with their supervisor/manager regarding scheduling and
reporting the extra break time. Where state law imposes more specific requirements regarding the break time or
lactation accommodation, the Company will comply with those requirements. Because exempt Teammates
receive their full salary during weeks in which they work, all exempt Teammates who need lactation
accommodation breaks do not need to report any extra break time as “unpaid.”
Teammates who desire lactation accommodations should request this accommodation immediately following
their return to work by accessing the Workplace Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at
AdvantageBenefits.net. The Company will not demote, terminate or otherwise take adverse action against a
Teammate who requests or makes use of the accommodations and break time described in this policy.
Page 25 of 26

Revised February 2025

If applicable state or local law in a Teammate’s primary work location differs from the provisions of this policy,
the Company will comply with such law to the extent it is required to do so.
The Company will otherwise treat lactation as a pregnancy-related medical condition and address lactationrelated needs in the same manner that it addresses other non-incapacitating medical conditions, including
requested time off for medical appointments, requested changes in schedules and other requested
accommodations.
Teammates should discuss with their supervisor/manager the location for storage of expressed milk. In addition,
Teammates should contact Human Resources during their pregnancy or before their return to work after giving
birth to identify the need for a lactation area.
For Teammates working in a jurisdiction that has a mandatory lactation accommodation law, the Company will
comply with all legal requirements, including providing greater or different benefits than those indicated here.

Paydays
For the purposes of calculating wage payments, except for Teammates working for Club Demonstration Services,
Inc. (“CDS”), the workday begins 12:00 a.m. and ends 11:59 p.m.; and the workweek begins Monday 12:00 a.m.
and ends Sunday 11:59 p.m. For Teammates working for CDS, the workday begins 12:01 a.m. and ends at midnight;
and the workweek begins Wednesday 12:01 a.m. and ends Tuesday at midnight.
The Company offers Teammates the opportunity to receive their earnings by direct deposit, live check or ADP
Wisely card. For additional information on these methods of payment and/or to make any changes, refer to the
Payroll Services page on the Company intranet.
Teammates will receive their wages according to the biweekly payroll schedule found on the Company intranet,
unless otherwise required by applicable law. If the Company’s regular biweekly payday falls on a holiday,
Teammates who utilize direct deposit or ADP Wisely card will receive their wages on the day before the observed
holiday. Live paychecks will be mailed to Teammates in advance of the scheduled pay date.

Payroll Corrections
The Company is committed to paying its Teammates correctly, but mistakes can happen. Teammates should
review each paycheck and pay stub as soon as it is received and make sure your pay is correct. If you believe an
error has occurred or if you have any questions about your pay, please promptly report the matter to your
supervisor or manager or promptly notify Human Resources by calling (888)-900-4276 or submitting a ticket via
ServiceNow. When mistakes do occur and are brought to the Company’s attention, the required corrections will
promptly be made.

Payroll Deductions
The law requires that the Company make certain deductions from the compensation a Teammate receives.
Deductions include applicable federal, state, and local income taxes and Social Security taxes. Upon a Teammate’s
request and authorization, the Company will also deduct appropriate amounts from a Teammate’s pay, as
required for participation in the Company’s voluntary benefit plans or other programs which serve to benefit the
Teammate.
In the event of an overpayment to a Teammate, the Company reserves the right to make appropriate payroll
deductions or use other alternative methods to recoup the overpayment, consistent with applicable federal and
Page 26 of 27

Revised February 2025

state law. Questions concerning payroll deductions should be directed to the HR Shared Services.
The Company takes precautions to ensure that Teammates are paid correctly; however, if an error does occur,
the Teammate should notify a supervisor/manager within two weeks. The Company will make every attempt to
adjust the error no later than the Teammate’s next regular pay period.
Additionally, the Company will comply with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and no improper
deductions from the salary of exempt Teammates will be permitted. An exempt Teammate's salary is not subject
to deductions for variations in the quantity and quality of the work performed, but would be subject to certain
deductions for:
• Full day absences related to disability;
• Full day disciplinary suspensions for infractions of written policies;
• Family and Medical Leave absences (full or partial day absences);
• Offsetting amounts received as payment for jury and witness fees or military pay;
• The first or last week of employment if you work less than a full week; and/or
• Deductions required by law or permitted by law and authorized by the Teammate.
In any work week in which you work, an exempt Teammate’s salary may not be reduced for the following reasons:
• Partial day absences for personal reasons, sickness or disability;
• An absence due to a day when the facility is closed on a scheduled workday;
• Absences for jury duty, witness duty, or military leave in any week you perform work; and/or
• Any other deduction prohibited by state or federal law.
If you have questions about deductions from your pay, please contact your supervisor/manager or Human
Resources immediately. Your concerns will be fully investigated and, where appropriate, corrective action will be
taken. The Company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report violations of this policy.

Discussion of Wages
No Teammate is prohibited from inquiring about, discussing or disclosing their own wages or those of another
Teammate. The Company will not terminate, demote, suspend, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against any
Teammate on the basis of such a disclosure or because they file a complaint or charge or otherwise institute an
investigation, proceeding or hearing based on the disclosure of wage information.
This does not apply to the unauthorized disclosure of other Teammates' wage information by those acting on
behalf of the Company with access to such information as part of their job duties. Company representatives may
disclose Teammates' wages in response to a complaint or charge, or an investigation, proceeding, hearing or other
legal action as appropriate or required by law.

Overtime Compensation
When business needs cannot be met during regular working hours, you may be scheduled to work overtime. Nonexempt Teammates will be paid overtime compensation as required by applicable federal, state and local laws
based on their primary work location. Overtime pay is calculated based on actual hours worked. Vacation, sick
time, Company and floating holidays and any other paid time off and leaves of absence will not be considered
hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime. Exempt Teammates working on a salary basis are not eligible
to earn overtime pay.
All overtime work performed by non-exempt Teammates must be authorized in advance. The Teammate may be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, for failing to obtain advance approval. However, a
non-exempt Teammate who works overtime hours without authorization will still be compensated for the time
Page 27 of 28

Revised February 2025

worked.

Work Schedules
Work schedules for Teammates vary throughout our organization. Supervisors/managers will advise Teammates
of their individual work schedules. Staffing needs and operational demands may necessitate variations in starting
and ending times, as well as variations in the locations and the total hours that may be scheduled each day and
week for each Teammate. The Company will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding
scheduling Teammates.

Business Travel and Reimbursement
The Company will reimburse Teammates for reasonable, ordinary and necessary business expenses, which are
incurred by a Teammate in the performance of assigned job duties and responsibilities. Since it is not practical to
set forth every allowable expense, Teammates should exercise sound business judgment and common sense
whenever they incur expenses for which they will expect reimbursement. The Company reserves the right to not
reimburse (or limit reimbursement for) any travel, entertainment, or other expenses it determines to be
unreasonable, contrary to the intent of the Company or in violation of any government regulations.
Reimbursements for acceptable expenditures are limited to actual, reasonable expenses incurred by the
Teammate in the conduct of Company business.
For more information regarding the Company’s Business Expense Reimbursement Policy and how to submit an
Expense Report, please refer to the Company intranet under the Teammate Resources – Travel & Expense tab.
For more information on travel, please review the Company’s Travel and Expense policy.

Mileage and Drive Time Reimbursement
Effective March 2025, non-exempt, hourly Teammates that drive a vehicle to various locations as part of their job
duties are eligible to receive mileage reimbursement at a rate of $0.36 per mile (although, it may be higher in
some states or by customer account). The applicable rate applies to all travel in-between locations during a
Teammate’s shift. However, during a Teammate’s commute from home to their first store, they will only receive
mileage reimbursement for any travel that exceeds 40 miles. The same threshold applies for a Teammate’s
commute home from their last store. For example, if a Teammate drives fifty (50) miles to their first store, they
will be reimbursed for ten (10) miles at the established rate. Similarly, If a Teammate drives fifty (50) miles from
their last store to home, they will be reimbursed for ten (10) miles at the established reimbursement rate.
Non-exempt, hourly Teammates that drive to various locations as part of their job duties are also eligible to receive
drive time reimbursement, which is reimbursed at a Teammate’s base hourly rate. Teammates will be reimbursed
for all drive time between store locations during their shift. However, during a Teammate’s commute from home
to their first store, they will only receive drive time reimbursement for travel that exceeds sixty (60) minutes. The
same threshold applies during a Teammate’s commute from their last store to home. As an example, if a
Teammate drives one hour and 15 minutes to their first store, they will be reimbursed for 15 minutes of pay at
their standard hourly rate. Similarly, if their commute is one hour and 15 minutes from their last store to home,
they will be reimbursed for 15 minutes of pay at their standard hourly rate.
For more information regarding mileage and drive time reimbursement, please refer to the Company’s Travel
policy or Teammates should reach out to their direct manager or supervisor.

Bonuses and Awards
A Teammate may receive additional income in the form of bonus, commission, incentive, gift card or other awards
Page 28 of 29

Revised February 2025

(collectively, “Rewards”) resulting from participation in one or more of the Company’s Rewards and Recognition
programs. Company management will partner with the Total Rewards Department to administer the Company’s
Rewards and Recognition programs according to program guidelines and in compliance with all applicable tax
requirements.
Teammates are not eligible for programs developed directly by a customer or client of the Company without the
express written knowledge and consent of management. Management reserves the right to approve or disallow
any such third-party sponsored program.
All monies distributed through such programs will be issued through the standard payroll processes. Cash or
noncash payments from Clients or Customers directly to a Company Teammate violate the Company’s policy
under all circumstances.
Teammates are encouraged to review the Company’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics for information regarding
Accounting and Financial Practices. In addition, please see Section on Gifts, Meals and Entertainment for
additional information.

TIME AWAY FROM WORK
Company Holidays
Teammates are eligible to receive paid Company holidays immediately upon assignment to a regular, full-time
position. Teammates in part-time, temporary and seasonal positions are not eligible for paid Company holidays.
The Company will generally observe core holidays. However, Business Units may have their own holiday schedules
and the Company has the right to modify or change any holiday schedule at any time. Business Units may also
have early release days or allow for modifications to scheduled shifts. The holiday schedule will be posted on the
Company intranet before the end of the calendar year for the upcoming calendar year.
If a Company holiday falls during an eligible Teammate’s sick time, vacation time or floating holiday, Company
holiday pay will be provided instead of such time. Company holidays are not paid during any leave of absence.
Company holiday hours are not considered time worked and will not be counted for the purposes of calculating
overtime. Further, Company holidays do not carry over from one calendar year to the next and are not paid out
upon termination of employment.
On occasion, compelling business needs may result in a manager having to require a Teammate to work on a
Company holiday. If an eligible non-exempt Teammate works on a Company holiday, they will receive holiday pay
based on an eight-hour workday plus wages at the hourly rate applicable to the work performed, unless otherwise
subject to applicable state and local laws. Exempt Teammates paid a weekly salary will receive no more than their
normal weekly salary for any week in which a holiday falls irrespective of whether they perform work on the
holiday.

Floating Holidays
Page 29 of 30

Revised February 2025

Floating holidays allow Teammates to take time off for any reason and at any time the Teammate wants, thereby
enhancing Teammates’ work-life balance and accommodating the needs of a diverse employee population (e.g.,
Teammates of different faiths and traditions).
All Teammates eligible for holiday pay will be awarded up to two paid floating holidays per year. Floating holidays
are generally awarded to Teammates at the start of each calendar year. However, in the initial year of hire or
eligibility, floating holidays are awarded as follows:
Floating Holiday Award Schedule
Hire/Transfer Date

Floating Holidays Awarded

January – April
May – August
September – December

2
1
0

Teammates must have management approval before taking their floating holidays. The Company reserves the
right to decline requests as well as to schedule and/or require Teammates to take floating holidays at times
designated by the Company.
Subject to applicable law, floating holidays must be taken in the calendar year in which they were awarded, and
payment in lieu of floating holidays shall not be provided. The Company will not pay out awarded but unused
Floating holidays upon separation of employment or allow for carry-over of unused Floating holidays from one
calendar year to another unless required by state or other applicable law.
Notwithstanding that, where payout and/or carry-over is required by applicable state law, the Teammate’s total
floating holiday balance may accrue to a cap of two times the maximum annual award of floating holidays (i.e.,
four days). Once the maximum amount has been reached, no additional floating holidays will be earned until
previously earned floating holidays are used. Teammates will not be given retroactive credit for any period of time
in which they do not earn floating holidays because they were at the maximum. At year-end, unused floating
holidays at or below the maximum amount will carry over to the subsequent year. Upon termination of
employment, Teammates will be paid for all floating holidays that have been earned but remain unused through
the last day of work where required by applicable law. Floating holidays will be paid at the Teammate’s regular
rate of pay in effect at the time of termination of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may implement other arrangements for floating holidays as the
Company deems appropriate. However, any such other arrangement must be in writing specifically approved by
the Chief Human Resources Officer or CEO of the Company.

Regular, Part-Time. Part-time Teammates in select divisions may be eligible to accrue vacation time. Please refer
to the Teammate Resources, Policies and Procedures, Human Resources tab on the Company intranet for
applicable Part-time Teammate Vacation Policies.
Requesting Vacation Time. Teammates are required to obtain supervisor/manager approval as far in advance of
their vacation time as possible, but in no circumstance should the approval be received less than 14-days before
their vacation time. Approvals will be based on business needs and staffing requirements. While
supervisors/managers will make every effort to honor a Teammate’s vacation request, they reserve the right to
decline requests or require Teammates to take vacation at designated times.
Requesting Unaccrued Vacation Time. Teammates are strongly discouraged from taking vacation time before
enough time has accrued. Any request to do so requires the approval of the Teammate’s supervisor/manager as
well as the next level management. Additionally, subject to applicable law, the Company reserves the right to
offset, carry-over or obtain reimbursement from the Teammate for the overpayment of vacation time.
Using Vacation Time. Accrued vacation hours can be used up to a maximum of eight hours per day for exempt
Teammates and up to a maximum of 10 hours per day for non-exempt Teammates, based on the Teammate’s
regular work schedule.
Treatment of Accrued but Unused Vacation. The Company, where required to do so by law, will carry over
accrued but unused vacation time from one calendar year to the next up to the maximum amount allowed as
indicated by the above Full-time and Part-time accrual charts and as state or other applicable law require.
However, if not required by law, accrued but unused vacation time will not carry over from one calendar year to
the next. Additionally, the Company will pay out accrued but unused vacation time upon termination of
employment where required by state or other applicable law. However, if not required by law, the Company will
Page 31 of 32

Revised February 2025

not pay out accrued but unused vacation time upon termination of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may implement other arrangements for vacation as the Company
deems appropriate. However, any such other arrangement must be in writing specifically approved by the Chief
Human Resources Officer or CEO of the Company.
The Company reserves the right to require the use of vacation or require that vacation be scheduled or taken
during certain times of the year, in accordance with business needs and its sole discretion.
Questions regarding vacation eligibility, accrual and requests should be directed to the Teammate’s
supervisor/manager or Human Resources.

Sick Time
Regular full-time Teammates will be awarded 40 hours of paid sick time that can be used after the conclusion of
90 days of continuous employment. They will be awarded 40 hours of paid sick time at the beginning of each
subsequent calendar year. If a Teammate’s primary work location is in a jurisdiction with an applicable paid sick
leave law that has a higher annual maximum accrual amount, the Teammate will receive the maximum accrual
amount in accordance with that applicable paid sick leave law. They will be awarded that amount of paid sick time
at the beginning of each calendar year accordingly.
Teammates may use their paid sick time for the following reasons:
• The Teammate’s own mental or physical illness, injury or medical condition;
• The Teammate’s need for medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a physical or mental illness, injury or
health condition or need for preventative medical care (e.g., doctor, dentist or eye appointment);
• To care for or assist a family member who needs treatment for a mental or physical illness, injury or health
condition or who needs medical diagnosis, treatment or preventive medical care; and/or
• Any other reason provided for and specified by applicable law.
Eligible Teammates may be provided additional paid sick and safe time to use in accordance with applicable state
or local laws. Temporary and Seasonal Teammates are not eligible for paid sick time, unless required by applicable
state and local laws. Please see state and municipal specific paid sick time requirements under the Teammate
Resources, Required Postings section on the Company intranet.
As required, a Teammate’s paid sick time will be used to supplement Company or state disability insurance
payments if requested by the Teammate and as permitted by applicable law. The combination of disability
payments and paid sick time benefits shall not, however, ever exceed the Teammate’s ordinary weekly earnings.
Benefits provided under state or local law. If paid sick time benefits and requirements mandated by applicable
state or local law exceed that which Company policy provides, the Company will comply with those requirements
to the extent it is required to do so, including without limitation, requirements for accrual eligibility, accrual rates,
ability to carry over accrued but unused time, payout of accrued but unused time upon termination, use
requirements and receipt of previously accrued sick time balances upon reinstatement of employment with the
Company. Teammates are encouraged to review their state-specific information under the Teammate Resources,
Required Postings section on the Company intranet for specific information pertaining to state and local sick time
benefits.
Part-time, Temporary and Seasonal Teammates are not eligible for paid sick time, except as required by applicable
state and local laws. Please refer to the Company Non-Full-Time Paid Sick and Safe Time Policy on the Human
Resources Policies and Procedures section of the Company intranet. For specific paid sick time requirements by
state and municipality, please see the Teammate Resources, Required Postings section on the Company intranet.

“Spouse” means the other person with whom an individual entered into marriage as defined or
recognized under state law for purposes of marriage in the state in which the marriage was entered into,
or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside of any state, if the marriage is valid in the place where
entered into and could have been entered into in at least one State. This includes common law marriage
and same sex marriage in places where these marriages are recognized.
“Key employee” means a salaried FMLA-eligible employee who is among the highest paid 10 percent of
all the employees employed by the employer within 75 miles of the employee's worksite.

Length of Leave. The maximum amount of FMLA Leave will be 12 workweeks in any 12-month period when the
leave is taken for: (1) Bonding Leave; (2) Family Care Leave; (3) Serious Health Condition Leave; and/or (4) Military
Emergency Leave. However, if both spouses work for the Company and are eligible for leave under this policy, the
spouses will be limited to a total of 12 workweeks off between the two of them when the leave is for Bonding
Leave or to care for a parent using Family Care Leave. The applicable "12-month period" utilized by the Company
is a 12-month period measured backward from the day the Teammate uses any FMLA leave.
The maximum amount of FMLA Leave for a Teammate wishing to take Military Caregiver Leave will be a combined
leave total of 26 workweeks in a single 12-month period. A "single 12-month period" begins on the date of the
Teammate's first use of such leave and ends 12 months after that date.
If both spouses work for the Company and are eligible for leave under this policy, the spouses will be limited to a
total of 26 workweeks off between the two when the leave is for Military Caregiver Leave only or is for a
combination of Military Caregiver Leave, Bonding Leave and/or Family Care Leave taken to care for a parent.
To the extent required by law, some extensions to leave beyond a Teammate’s FMLA entitlement may be granted
when the leave is necessitated by a Teammate's work-related injury or illness or by a “disability” as defined under
the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or applicable state or local law. Certain restrictions on these benefits may
apply.
Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave. Under some circumstances, Teammates may take FMLA Leave
intermittently, which means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing the Teammate's normal weekly or daily
work schedule. A Teammate may take leave intermittently whenever it is medically necessary to care for a
seriously ill family member, or because the Teammate is seriously ill and unable to work.
Leave taken intermittently may be taken in increments of no less than one hour. Teammates who take leave
intermittently or on a reduced work schedule basis for a planned medical treatment must make a reasonable
effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the Company’s operations. Please contact Human
Resources before scheduling planned medical treatment. If FMLA Leave is taken intermittently or on a reduced
schedule basis due to foreseeable planned medical treatment, we may require Teammates to transfer temporarily
to an available alternative position with an equivalent pay rate and benefits, including a part-time position, to
better accommodate recurring periods of leave.
If a Teammate’s request for intermittent leave is approved, the Company may later require Teammates to obtain
recertification of their need for leave. For example, the Company may request recertification if it receives
information that casts doubt on a Teammate's report that an absence qualifies for FMLA Leave.
Notice and Certifications. Teammates are required to provide notice 30 days in advance when the need is
foreseeable or if the leave must begin in less than 30 days (normally this would be the same day the Teammate
becomes aware of the need for leave or the next business day). Depending on the reason for the FMLA leave,
Page 34 of 35

Revised February 2025

completed certifications and documentation will be required for leave approval. Information and certification
requirements, including recertification requirements and forms, are available on Advantage Benefits at
AdvantageBenefits.net.
Benefits During Leave. The Company will continue making contributions for group health benefits during a
Teammate’s FMLA leave on the same terms as if the Teammate had continued to work. This means that if the
Teammate wants their benefits coverage to continue during their leave, the Teammate must continue to make
any premium payments they are required to make for themselves and/or dependents.
Teammates taking Bonding Leave, Family Care Leave, Serious Health Condition Leave and Military Emergency
Leave will generally be provided with group health benefits for a 12-workweek period. Teammates taking Military
Caregiver Leave may be eligible to receive group health benefits coverage for up to a maximum of 26 workweeks.
In some instances, the Company may recover premiums it paid on the Teammate's behalf to maintain health
coverage if the Teammate fails to return to work following a FMLA Leave.
Except as required by COBRA, the Company’s obligation to maintain health benefits during an FMLA leave will
continue until:
• The employment relationship would have terminated if the Teammate had not taken FMLA leave.
• A Teammate informs the Company that they will not return from leave (including before starting the leave
if the employer is so informed before the leave starts).
• The Teammate fails to return from leave or continues to be on leave without approval after exhausting
their FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-month period.
During FMLA leave, Teammates maintain any employment benefit accrued before the date on which the leave
commences. However, consistent with the Company's policy for all types of unpaid leave, Teammates will not
accrue additional paid time off benefits (such as vacation) while on unpaid FMLA leave.
Compensation during FMLA Leave. Generally, FMLA Leave is unpaid. However, if a Teammate has accrued but
unused paid leave, the Teammate must exhaust all paid leave at the beginning of the FMLA leave. If a Teammate
is eligible to receive benefits through State or Company wage replacement programs, they may supplement these
benefits with accrued paid leave. All such payments will be integrated so that a Teammate will receive no more
than their regular compensation during the leave. The use of paid benefits will not extend the length of the FMLA
Leave.
Return from FMLA Leave. At the end of the FMLA leave, subject to some exceptions, a Teammate will be
reinstated to the same position the Teammate held before the leave or an equivalent position with equivalent
pay, benefits and other employment terms, subject to the limitations regarding reinstatement listed below.
Limitations on Reinstatement. A Teammate is entitled to reinstatement only if they would have continued to be
employed had FMLA leave not been taken. Thus, a Teammate is not entitled to reinstatement if, because of a
layoff, reduction in force or other reason, the Teammate would not be employed at the time job reinstatement
was sought. The Company reserves the right to deny reinstatement to Teammates classified as “Key Teammates”
if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury for the Company. Those Teammates
will be notified of the possible limitations on reinstatement at the time the Teammate requests a leave of absence.
Reasonable Accommodation Following FMLA Leave. To the extent required by law, some extensions to leave
beyond a Teammate’s FMLA entitlement may be granted when the leave is necessitated by a Teammate's workrelated injury/illness or a “disability” as defined under the Americans with Disabilities Act and/or applicable state
or local law. Certain restrictions on these benefits may apply. For additional information and to request a
reasonable accommodation, visit the Workplace Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at
Page 35 of 36

Revised February 2025

AdvantageBenefits.net.
Failure to Return to Work Following FMLA Leave. If the Teammate does not return to work at the end of their
FMLA leave and does not request a leave extension or fails to satisfy the Company’s requirements for a leave
extension, the Teammate will be considered to have voluntarily resigned. The Company may recover health
insurance premiums that it paid on behalf of the Teammate during any unpaid FMLA leave unless the Teammate
fails to return to work because of circumstances beyond their control. In such cases, the Company may require
the Teammate to provide medical certifications or other documentation that verifies the circumstances.
State Law. Some states have family leave laws providing benefits that exceed those available under the FMLA.
Nothing in this policy limits your rights under applicable state law. If your leave qualifies as leave under the FMLA
and applicable state law, then the leave will be counted under both statutes and run concurrently. In all cases,
you will have the benefit of the most generous leave statute, subject to eligibility requirements.
Additional Information. For information on state leave laws, leave eligibility, coordination of benefits and to apply
for a FMLA leave, Teammates should review the Leave of Absence section on Advantage Benefits at
AdvantageBenefits.net.
Additional details on FMLA are available at: https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.htm.

Medical Leave of Absence
If a Teammate needs a medical leave of absence, the Teammate should contact the Company’s Third-Party
Administrator to request a leave. Leaves will be granted in accordance with applicable federal and state law and
the Company’s accommodation policy. All determinations regarding reinstatement following leave, length of
leave and continuation of insurance during a leave will be granted in accordance with applicable law. The Company
may require certification from a health care provider prior the start of the leave, detailing the reasons for the
leave, as well as following the leave, releasing the Teammate back to work, with or without the need for additional
accommodations. The Company will comply with all applicable laws pertaining to providing reasonable
accommodations. Teammates should review the available options on the Leave of Absence section on Advantage
Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net.
Teammate Eligibility. All full-time and part-time Teammates who have been employed by the Company for at
least 90 days may be eligible for unpaid leave under this policy, if other qualifications for leave standards are met.
Documentation/Verification. Teammates seeking medical leave must return a completed medical certification to
the Company’s Third-Party Administrator. Teammates who submit incomplete, insufficient or illegible
certifications, or certifications that require clarification, will be required to obtain additional information from
their health care provider. Failure to timely comply with these certification or recertification requirements may
result in delay or denial of leave.
Benefits and Compensation. During a Teammate's unpaid leave, the Teammate is not entitled to paid holidays
and will not accrue vacation or sick hours. The Company will continue a Teammate's health insurance coverage
(including paying the Company's portion of any premium) during the Teammate's approved leave if the Teammate
continues to submit the Teammate's portion of the monthly premium payments in a timely manner during the
authorized leave period.
Return to Work. Teammates are expected to return to work immediately following a medical leave. Upon timely
return to work, the Company will attempt to return the Teammate to their original job, or to a similar position,
subject to prevailing business considerations. Reinstatement, however, is not guaranteed. If the Teammate's
position is no longer available, the Company will make a good faith effort to place the Teammate in a position of
Page 36 of 37

Revised February 2025

similar pay and responsibility, if the Teammate has the required skill and ability and is otherwise qualified for the
position.
A Teammate's failure to advise the Company and/or Third-Party Administrator of their availability to return to
work, failure to return to work when notified, or continued absence from work beyond the time approved by the
Company without notifying the Company of any extenuating circumstances preventing the Teammate's return,
will be considered a voluntary resignation of employment.

Bereavement Leave
The Company will provide up to three days of paid bereavement leave to regular full-time Teammates who need
time off due to the death of an immediate family member, except where allowed additional paid or unpaid time
off under applicable state or local law. “Immediate family” is defined as the Teammate’s spouse, legally
recognized/registered domestic partner, ex-spouse, ex-domestic partner, children (including step or foster),
siblings, stepsiblings, parents, stepparents, grandparents, step-grandparents, grandchildren, step-grandchildren
and the same for that of the Teammate’s spouse or legally recognized/registered domestic partner. Teammates
who wish to take time off due to these circumstances should notify their supervisor/manager as soon as they are
made aware of their need for a bereavement leave. The Company understands the deep impact that death can
have on an individual or family. Therefore, a Teammate may make arrangements with their supervisor/manager
for additional unpaid time off if approved. The Company will comply with all applicable federal, state, and local
laws regarding bereavement leave. For specific bereavement entitlements by state and municipality, please see
the Teammate Resources, Required Postings section on the Company intranet.

Military Leave
A military leave of absence will be granted to Teammates who are absent from work because of service in the
United States uniformed services in accordance with the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and any similar state law. Teammates are required to give their
supervisor/manager advance notice of their need for a leave, unless military necessity prevents such notice, or it
is otherwise impossible or unreasonable. The leave will be unpaid. However, Teammates may use any available
paid time off for the absence.
For additional details and to apply for a Military Leave, Teammates should review the Leave of Absence section
on Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net.

Jury Duty
The Company encourages Teammates to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving on jury duty when required.
The Company will grant full-time regular Teammates up to five consecutive working days of paid time off per
calendar year for jury duty, unless applicable state or local laws require additional time. Teammates may use
accrued but unused vacation or floating holiday hours as compensation for any hours that are unpaid. Temporary,
seasonal and part-time Teammates are not eligible to receive paid time off for jury duty service, unless otherwise
provided for by law. Exempt Teammates will not incur any reduction in pay for a partial week of absence due to
jury duty.
Teammates must give the Company advance notice of their need to serve. Furthermore, the Teammate must
submit written documentation that confirms their jury duty attendance to their supervisor/manager after
completion of each jury duty service date.

Witness Duty
Page 37 of 38

Revised February 2025

The Company encourages Teammates to appear in court for witness duty when subpoenaed to do so. If
Teammates have been subpoenaed or otherwise requested by the Company to testify as witnesses, they will
receive paid time off for the entire period of witness duty. Teammates will be granted unpaid time off to appear
as a witness when requested to appear by a party other than the Company. Teammates may use available vacation
or floating holiday hours as compensation for this absence. Exempt Teammates will not incur any reduction in pay
for a partial week of absence due to witness duty.
Teammates are required to show their supervisor/manager the subpoena immediately after it is received and
provide reasonable advance notice so that operating requirements can be adjusted to accommodate the
Teammate’s absence.

Parental Leave for School Visits
The Company recognizes the value of parental involvement in children’s education. For this reason, Teammates
who are parents, guardians, or custodians of children in licensed day care facilities or kindergarten through grade
12, will be provided a reasonable amount of unpaid time off for school visits and activities sponsored, approved
or supervised by the school or day care. Teammates who choose to take unpaid Parental Leave must provide their
supervisors/managers with reasonable advance notice and upon return from the leave, must provide
documentation that verifies the date and time of the visit.
Nothing in this policy limits your rights under the applicable state or local laws in your primary work location
including eligibility for paid parental leave or school activities time off provisions when applicable. In all cases, the
Company will comply with the applicable Parental Leave statute to the extent it is required to do so.

Time Off to Vote
The Company encourages all Teammates to fulfill their civic responsibilities and to vote in official public elections.
Generally, working hours are such that a Teammate will have ample time to cast a vote before or after the work
shift. If Teammates do not have sufficient time to vote, that Teammate should discuss the matter with a
supervisor/manager. The Company will comply with all applicable state and municipal voting time laws which can
be found here.

State and Local Laws
There are state and local laws that may or may not have been referenced in this section of the handbook. Those
laws may provide Teammates with benefits that differ from those referred to in this handbook. The Company is
committed to providing Teammates with leaves in accordance with all the federal, state and local laws in their
primary work location. Further, the Company provides details of all applicable state and local leaves on the
Company intranet. Teammates are encouraged to review the state-specific information and contact Human
Resources for clarification and additional details on any of the leaves of absence not specifically described in this
handbook.

TEAMMATE CONDUCT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Teammate Conduct and Work Rules Policy
The Company is committed to operating and maintaining a work environment built on professionalism, respect
and safety. Accordingly, Teammates are expected to act with integrity towards each other as well as clients,
customers and vendors (collectively “Business Partners”) and members of the public and to exercise sound
judgment and professionalism in carrying out their job responsibilities and otherwise representing the Company,
Page 38 of 39

Revised February 2025

its clients and customers.
Work rules are generally intended to apply to Teammate conduct during working time, at business or work related
events, while representing the Company and when on Company or Business Partner property. However, there
may be occasions where conduct outside of the workplace is determined by the Company to be job-related and
to impact a Teammate’s ability to effectively perform their job duties or represent the Company, its clients and
customers. In those instances, the Company reserves the right to consider such conduct unacceptable under
company policy and take disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Unacceptable conduct. The following list provides examples of some, but not all, forms of unacceptable conduct
and behavior that is against work rules that may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. It is
to serve as a guideline to help Teammates understand Company expectations as it relates to professional and
acceptable work-related conduct and is not intended to be an exhaustive list:
• Falsification of employment records (including time records), employment information or other records;
or providing misleading information in Company or Business Partner records.
• Theft or unauthorized removal, use, possession, or distribution of Company or Business Partner property
or the property of its or their Teammates or visitors.
• Negligence, failure to take reasonable steps to safeguard, or intentional conduct leading to loss or damage

• Performing another Teammate’s job duties or allowing another individual to perform one’s own job
duties, except as authorized by the Company or directed by management.
• Failure to cooperate promptly and honestly in a legitimate and lawful workplace inquiry or investigation.
• Retaliation against an individual for reporting a good faith complaint about the Company, for truthfully
participating in a workplace inquiry or investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Company or a
government entity, or for exercising one’s rights under Company policy or law.
• Provoking a physical fight or engaging in physical fighting during working hours or on Company or Business
Partner property at any time.

• Deliberate disregard for or failure to carry out legitimate and lawful work assignments and instructions
that is not associated with or related to any protected activity.
• Failure to adhere to legitimate and lawful Business Partner business requirements while they are
performing services for a Business Partner in connection with their employment with the Company.
• Teammates being unauthorized by assigned Business Partner to perform services for the Business Partner;
or Teammate’s failure to notify the Company of any such Business Partner restriction.
• Violation of the law, or of Company or team-specific policies and work rules including, without limitation,
those set forth in this Handbook on the Company intranet.
• Unsatisfactory performance, including without limitation, failure to satisfy the job duties set forth in one’s
job description or as otherwise communicated by one’s supervisor or management.

•
•

Other job-related conduct reasonably determined by the Company to be unacceptable, unprofessional, a
reflection of poor judgment, or unlawful.
Violation of any law, rule regulation or Company policy.

The Company may take disciplinary action, up to and including termination, against a Teammate for failing to
adhere to work rules and standards of acceptable conduct. Ignorance of work rules or what is considered
unacceptable conduct is not an acceptable excuse. It is each Teammate's responsibility to learn and abide by these
rules.
As explained above, Teammates are reminded that employment is at-will, unless applicable state law provides
otherwise. Accordingly, the Company reserves the right to take any type of disciplinary action it deems necessary,
including termination of employment.

Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace Policy
The Company is committed to safeguarding the health of its Teammates and to providing a safe place for its
Teammates to work. It is the policy of the Company to provide a work environment that is free from the use,
manufacture, dispensation, sale, possession or distribution of Illegal Drugs or the improper (i) use, (ii) sale, or (iii)
distribution of legal drugs or alcohol. It is also the policy of the Company to require all Teammates to perform
their job duties, without the presence of Illegal Drugs or illegal or inappropriate use of legal drugs and to prohibit
unauthorized alcohol consumption.
Violation of Policy. Everyone shares the responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment. Teammates are
required to abide by the terms of this policy. Violations of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to
and including immediate termination of employment.
Illegal Drugs and Alcohol. Teammates are prohibited from using, being impaired by, or being under the influence
of, alcohol or illegal drugs while working (onsite, remotely or otherwise) or while on Company premises, except
as noted below with respect to alcohol.
Teammates are prohibited from (1) consuming alcohol while working or while on Company premises and/or
(2) working while under the influence of alcohol except during client entertainment events or gatherings hosted
and approved by the Company. When consuming alcohol during such events, Teammates are required to limit
consumption and always maintain decorum and professional behavior and comply with all Company policies. The
Teammate – not the Company – shall be responsible for monitoring the Teammate's alcohol intake and behavior.
Teammates are also strictly prohibited from driving or otherwise operating a vehicle while or after consuming
alcohol at a Company-sponsored or client event. Teammates should walk, take public transportation or an Uber,
Lyft or other car service or taxi home.
For purposes of this policy, “illegal drugs” means and includes (a) any drugs which are illegal under federal, state
or local law or (b) legally prescribed drugs not prescribed to the user or (c) even where prescribed to the user,
abuse or use of said drugs in a manner inconsistent with the prescription or purpose for which the drugs were
prescribed. Furthermore, the possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs or controlled substances without a
prescription at any time is prohibited.
Permissible Use of Substances. Teammates who must use prescribed drugs during work are responsible for being
aware of any effect such substances may have on the performance of their duties. If Teammates find that certain
medications impair their performance, they should report this fact to Human Resources, along with acceptable
medical documentation. The Company will then explore with the Teammate and any other relevant parties
whether the Teammate is able to perform their job safely and properly with or without accommodations.
Page 40 of 41

Revised February 2025

Rights to Search. Teammates' possessions, vehicles and Company-issued equipment and containers under
Teammates' control are subject to reasonable search and surveillance at all times while on Company premises, or
while otherwise conducting Company business, in compliance with all applicable laws.
Reasonable Suspicion of Violations. Supervisors/managers are to immediately report to Human Resources any
action or observation that suggests a Teammate may be impaired by drugs or alcohol while at work. Human
Resources and the supervisor/manager will work together to evaluate and determine whether the Teammate
should be examined by a physician or clinic and/or tested for drugs and alcohol. Observations leading to
reasonable suspicion determinations will be reasonably contemporaneous with the request for a test. If the
Teammate is suspected of being impaired, arrangements will be made to transport the Teammate home or to an
alternate safe location. The Teammate will not be allowed to drive.
Drug Testing. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Teammates may be asked to take a test to
determine the presence of drugs or alcohol. Testing will be performed in accordance with applicable legal
standards and methods. A drug test may be a condition of employment or continued employment. The Company
reserves the right to test Teammates for the presence of illegal drugs and in some cases alcohol in the following
circumstances, except where such tests are limited or prohibited by law:
• During the hiring process to determine whether a candidate is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
• Upon reasonable suspicion by the Company.
• Following an accident on Company premises or involving Company equipment.
• Following drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation to determine whether the Teammate is fit for duty.
• On a random basis, for Teammates who have returned from a drug and/or alcohol counseling, treatment
and/or rehabilitation program.
A Teammate’s employment or continued employment with the Company is conditioned upon their full compliance
with this policy. It is a violation of this policy to refuse to submit to lawfully requested testing. A refusal to test
includes any behavior designed to obstruct the testing process, including efforts to substitute, adulterate or dilute
specimens, as well as any failure to appear for testing within a reasonable time and failure to cooperate with
collection staff. All Teammates will be required to sign a consent form authorizing the test as well as authorizing
the use of the test results for purposes of administering these policies.
Use of Test Results. Tests that are paid for by the Company are considered property of the Company. The
examination records will be treated as confidentially as possible. However, the Company reserves the right to
release test results to the decision-maker in any proceeding initiated by the Teammate, related to the results of
an alcohol and/or drug test, or if the Company determines that the individual has engaged in conduct prohibited
by this policy. The Company also reserves the right to release test results as required by a subpoena, court order,
other judicial process or as otherwise allowed or required by applicable law. In addition, records of specific
examinations may be made available to the Teammate, or person designated by the Teammate, upon receipt of
written authorization by the Teammate.
Teammate Assistance. Teammates who are experiencing work-related problems resulting from drug or alcohol
abuse or dependency may request, or be required to seek, counseling, which may be a condition of continued
employment. Counseling sponsored or required by the Company is to be kept confidential and is to have no
influence on performance appraisals, unless such counseling is so involved as to affect job performance in the sole
discretion of management. Job performance alone, not the fact that a Teammate seeks counseling, is to be the
basis of all performance appraisals.
Any Teammate who is abusing drugs or alcohol may, in management's sole discretion, be granted a leave of
absence to undertake rehabilitation treatment. The Teammate will not be permitted to return to work until
certification is presented to Human Resources that the Teammate is capable of performing their job, is no longer
Page 41 of 42

Revised February 2025

under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol and will refrain from any further abuse of such substances. The
Teammate may also be subject to a return-to-duty test. Failure to cooperate with an agreed-upon course of
treatment may result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. Participation in a treatment
program does not insulate a Teammate from the imposition of discipline for violations of this or other Company
policies.
Convictions. Teammates are also required, as a condition of employment, to notify their supervisor/manager
within 5 calendar days of any workplace-related criminal drug convictions in which they were involved. A
conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contendre, or imposition of a sentence or both by any
judicial body charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the federal or state drug statutes. If a
Teammate’s position requires that he/she/they operate a motor vehicle, the Teammate must notify the Company
of any DUI/DWI, alcohol-related conviction or driver's license restriction.

Company’s Right to Search
The Company wishes to maintain a work environment that is free of illegal drugs, firearms, explosives or other
improper materials. To this end, the Company prohibits the control, possession, transfer, sale or use of such
materials on its premises to the extent permitted by applicable law. We require the cooperation of all Teammates
in administering this policy.
Desks, lockers and other storage devices are provided for the convenience of Teammates but remain the sole
property of the Company or its Business Partners. Accordingly, they, as well as any articles found within them, can
be inspected by any agent or representative of the Company at any time, either with or without prior notice.
In addition, to ensure the safety and security of Teammates and customers and to protect our legitimate business
interests, we reserve the right to question and inspect or search any Teammate or other individual entering or
leaving company premises or third-party client job sites by a Company management Teammate. The inspection
or search may include any packages or items that the individual may be carrying, including briefcases, handbags,
knapsacks, shopping bags, etc. If a non-exempt Teammate is present during any search or inspection, they must
record the time spent during the search or inspection as working time.
These items are subject to inspection and search at any time, with or without prior notice, Teammates. The
individual may be requested to self-inspect their personal property or person by displaying the contents of any
packages and/or turning out their pockets, etc., in the presence of a representative of the Company, typically a
management Teammate of the same gender. The Company will not tolerate any Teammate's refusal to submit to
a search.
Teammates may also be subject to an inspection or search on a third-party client job site by a client management
employee, to ensure the client’s safety, security and/or business interests. Those inspections or searches are
independent from Company conduct and such decisions are made and carried out solely by third-party clients.

Attendance and Punctuality
Teammates are expected to report to their workplace on time and remain at work for their entire work schedule,
except when on rest or meal periods or when otherwise authorized to leave. Unapproved or unprotected late
arrivals, early departures or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided.
If Teammates are unable to report for work on any day, they must call their supervisor/manager as soon as
practical, but no later than two hours before the time the Teammate is scheduled to begin work. Unless
extenuating circumstances exist, Teammates must call in each day they are scheduled but are unable to report to
work.
Page 42 of 43

Revised February 2025

Excessive absenteeism or tardiness may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment, unless the absence or tardiness is excused time off, sick leave or a leave of absence provided in
accordance with Company policy or mandated by applicable federal, state or local laws in a Teammate’s work
location.
Unless there are extenuating circumstances or a legally protected reason, if a Teammate fails to report to work
without any notification and fails to respond to communication from a supervisor (including by phone or email)
within a specified deadline, the Company will consider that the Teammate has abandoned their job and voluntarily
terminated their employment.
If the Teammate believes that their absence, tardiness or early departure is (or should be) excused pursuant to
applicable law, the Teammate should notify their manager and Human Resources of this fact as soon as possible,
but no later than at the time of the absence, tardiness or early departure. (For the required timing of a Teammate’s
notice of the need for a foreseeable leave of absence, see the applicable leave policy). If a Teammate believes
they have been mistakenly subject to disciplinary action for an absence, tardiness or early departure that the
Teammate believes is or should be excused/approved, the Teammate should promptly discuss the matter with
their manager or Human Resources. The Company will investigate the situation and any errors will be corrected.

Dress and Presentation
The Company promotes a casual, professional work environment that includes a “Dress for the Business Day”
approach. Teammates are expected to select smart casual, business casual or professional business dress,
depending on the type of work performed, nature of the business and/or general workplace events that day.
Additionally, every Teammate must exercise sound judgment regarding their presentation, including dress,
grooming and hygiene, which should be neat, clean, professional, safe and appropriate for the workplace.
Although not exhaustive, the following provides guidelines on what the Company considers acceptable and
unacceptable dress and presentation. Teammates may also be notified of mandatory dress code requirements
and restrictions specific to their division or department that must be followed.
Examples of acceptable presentation
• Professional business dress includes suits, dresses, jackets and dress pants/skirts, dress shirts, ties.
• Business casual dress includes non-denim pants, slacks, skirts, dresses, button-down shirts/blouses.
• Smart casual dress includes business casual jeans, below the knee capris, collared shirts, sweaters.
• Hairstyles, jewelry, accessories and makeup should be appropriate, neat and professional.
Examples of Unacceptable Presentation
• Overalls, leggings, shorts, mini-skirts, beachwear, sleepwear, t-shirts, athletic/exercise clothes.
• Dirty, wrinkled, torn or ripped clothes.
• Sheer, improperly fitting or revealing clothes.
• Flip flops or slippers.
• Clothing with words or pictures which are unprofessional or violate any Company policy.
• Jewelry, accessories, hair styles, shoes, or attire which create a safety hazard.
• Distracting, excessive or unpleasant odors.
• Failure to cover tattoos that may be deemed offensive by others.
The Company will comply with applicable legal requirements related to this policy. Accordingly, as explained
above, the Company will reasonably accommodate Teammates with a disability or sincerely held religious belief
or practice or who are pregnant, unless it would impose an undue hardship on the Company. To request an
Page 43 of 44

accommodation, Teammates should refer to the Workplace Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at
AdvantageBenefits.net.
If Teammates have any doubt about their attire, they should not wear the clothing or ask their direct supervisor
or manager before wearing it. Teammates who fail to comply with this policy will be asked to change clothing. A
non-exempt Teammate’s time away for this purpose will be unpaid, subject to Company policy and applicable law.
Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
Teammates may also need to adhere to any specific client or customer dress code policies, subject to applicable
law. Should Teammates have any questions regarding a client or customer dress code policy, they should reach
out to their direct manager or supervisor.

Gifts, Meals, and Entertainment
The purpose of business gifts, meals and entertainment in a commercial setting is to create goodwill and sound
working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with clients or customers. Teammates must act in a fair and
impartial manner in all business dealings. Gifts, meals and entertainment should further the business interests of
the Company and not be construed as potentially improperly influencing business judgment or creating an
obligation. For this reason, the Company discourages the exchange of gifts for business purposes and places limits
on meals and entertainment.
Teammates are charged with making impartial decisions and recommendations for the Company and on behalf
of our clients and customers in the area of client, customer and vendor service and selection. As such, Teammates
are prohibited from receiving directly or indirectly any incentives from past, present or potential clients,
customers or vendors who may be selected to receive or provide products or services directly to the Company or
via the Company to our clients and customers. Incentives include but are not limited to gifts, monetary exchanges,
entertainment, celebratory meals or refreshments, special access, memberships or offering to give anything of
value in order to influence any action or decision; provided, however, that the foregoing does not restrict (1)
business-purpose meals or refreshments or (2) gifts of value under $100. The term “gift” includes any gratuity,
favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance, or other item having monetary value, including
services, training, transportation, lodging and meals, whether provided in kind, by purchase of a ticket, payment
in advance or reimbursement after the expense has been incurred. Any gifts of value ranging from $100-$250
must be approved by a direct supervisor/manager while gifts of value more than $250 must be approved by a
respective ELT leader. Any additional exceptions to this Policy must be approved by at least two of the following
executives: the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), or the Chief
Legal Officer (CLO). This activity will be monitored and actively supported by leadership. Any Teammate who does
not comply with the above will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
Teammates may accept courtesies from a client when the courtesy is in connection with and specifically pursuant
to a performance-based program officially authorized by the client and approved by the Company’s division
leader.
When acting on the Company’s behalf, Teammates may give gifts, meals or entertainment only if:
• It is permitted by law;
• It serves a valid business purpose;
• It cannot be constructed as a bribe, obligation or payoff;
• Any gifts are reasonable, customary and not significant in value;
• Any meals or entertainment are reasonable and would not embarrass the Company or Teammate if
publicly disclosed; and
• All expenditures are accurately recorded in the Company’s financial records.
Page 44 of 45

Revised February 2025

When interacting with clients, customers, suppliers or other Third Parties:
• Do not ask someone for a gift, meal or entertainment; and
• Do not give cash or cash equivalents like gift certificates unless specifically allowed and approved by the
Legal Department.
Special rules govern the Company’s relationships with government personnel and Teammates of certain
companies, such as our customers and vendors that support government contracts.
Gifts that Teammates may offer a government Teammate are limited to:
• Company-approved advertising item of nominal value (such as a pen, cap or T-shirt);
• modest items of food and refreshment, such as soft drinks, coffee and doughnuts offered other than as
part of a meal; or
• plaques and certificates of recognition.
Except for these three limited exceptions, Teammates must receive prior approval from the Company’s CEO or
CLO in order for them to give or offer a gift to a government Teammate or a member of their immediate family.
Sales-related commissions, rebates, discounts, credits and allowances are customary business inducements, but
careful attention is needed to avoid illegal or unethical payments and to ensure compliance with various
applicable laws and regulations.
For more detail on treatment of bonuses, awards, gifts and incentives for pay purposes, please see Section titled
“Bonuses and Awards.”

Outside Contacts
Any inquiries received in connection with a Company investigation must be handled in a consistent manner. All
contacts related to Company business from an outside attorney or investigator, a court or a government agency
seeking information from the Company must immediately be referred to the Company’s Legal Department at
generalcounsel@youradv.com, without any further discussions with the contact. If the contact involves a criminal
investigation, Company counsel will advise you of your options.

Media Inquiries
From time to time a Teammate may receive inquiries from the media, i.e., newspapers, television stations, radio
stations, magazines, websites, digital marketers, industry/association publications or other periodicals. Only those
designated by the CEO may comment to the media on behalf of the Company on Company policy or events
relevant to the Company. If a Teammate were to receive any media inquiry, the Teammate should decline to make
any comment on behalf of the Company and refer the inquirer to the Chief Communications Officer (CCO) or Chief
Legal Officer (CLO). Their contact information is available on the Company intranet. This rule does not prevent you
from speaking with the media, but you may not attempt to speak on behalf of the Company unless you have
specifically been authorized to do so by the CEO, CCO, or CLO.

Client / Customer Assignment Policy
The Company represents many clients and customers that are considered “Third Parties.” The Company asks
Teammates to keep in mind the following when working with Third Parties:
• Our Teammates are Teammates of the Company, not the Third Party.
• Our Teammates are expected to abide by our Company’s policies and procedures
• Our Teammates are expected to adhere to Third Party policies and procedures, when applicable
Page 45 of 46

Revised February 2025

•
•
•
•

Our Teammates may be required to undergo a Complete Blood Count screening or other screening to be
on a Third Party’s property
Questions regarding Company policies, one’s job expectations, or other workplace matters should be
directed to a Company supervisor/manager or Human Resources.
Teammates are expected to receive and take direction regarding job expectations and performance from
their Company supervisor/manager, although Third Parties may communicate task-execution
information.
Third Party communications which appear to be against Company policy or legal or ethical obligations and
any other concerns pertaining to Third Parties, must be promptly escalated to your immediate
supervisor/manager or using another reporting channel pursuant to the Company’s Open Door Policy.

Document Retention Policy
The Company’s Records Management and Retention Policies ensure that the maintenance and destruction of
Company records is in accordance with all applicable laws. Teammates are required to become familiar with and
comply with the Company’s Records Management and Retention Policies. The policies are on the Company
intranet under the Legal Department’s Policies and Procedures.

Document Disposal Policy
To protect the privacy of consumer report information (such as information contained in a background screening
report) and any information containing a consumer’s personal or financial information, Teammates should ensure
that the information is properly disposed of in a manner that is reasonable and appropriate to prevent
unauthorized access of the information when no longer needed.

Social Media Policy
Social media can take many forms, including online social networks, message boards, conversation pages, internet
forums and blogs, online profiles, wikis, podcasts, pictures, video, email, instant messaging, music-sharing and
voice-over IP, to name just a few. Social media applications can include LinkedIn, Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube,
Twitter, Yelp, Glassdoor, etc.
The Company encourages all teammates to engage in respectful, positive dialogue that illustrates how to win
together and consistently serve clients, consumers and communities with heart at Advantage Solutions. It is not
the Company’s intention to restrict your ability to have an online presence, nor should this policy be construed to
restrict or interfere with any Teammate’s rights under applicable law. Instead, the purpose is to define the
Company’s position regarding Teammates’ social media postings and communications and comply with applicable
law and Company policies. The general message is to be thoughtful about how you present yourself online and
take steps to ensure that any content is in keeping with the following guidelines:
•
•

•
•
•

Do not post or communicate confidential, trade secret or proprietary information about the Company or
its Business Partners.
Do not post or communicate confidential information or private information of other teammates,
including credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, driver's and other license numbers, addresses or
any other information that is not publicly accessible.
Teammates must adhere to all Company’s policies when using social media, including the Company’s
policies against harassment, discrimination, retaliation and workplace violence.
Do not post or communicate anything that violates any copyright, fair use, trade secret or financial
disclosure laws.
Do not post content related to our Business Partners without explicit permission. Our Business Partners’
privacy is a priority for Advantage Solutions. While you are encouraged to share pictures or descriptions
Page 46 of 47

•

•

of your work, including in-store activations or participation in company or partner events, any information
related to our partners must be cleared by the partner, the Corporate Communications team and other
internal stakeholders, as necessary — in advance. Similarly, Advantage Solutions’ teammates should not
contact customers for social reasons or solicit them outside of traditional business activities.
Do not use personal social media during work time.
The Company has well established means to communicate publicly. Only those officially designated by the
Company have the authorization to speak on behalf of the Company.
Each Teammate bears full responsibility for any material they post on social media.
Privacy settings should be used when appropriate. However, Teammates should be aware that their social
media postings and communications may still be viewable by the public.
In any post or communication in which you endorse the Company, its Business Partners (if permission is
granted) or related products, services or Teammates, you must include a disclaimer that clearly identifies
you as a Company Teammate and makes it clear that the views you express do not necessarily reflect the
views of the Company or its Business Partners. This rule is required by the Federal Trade Commission’s
endorsement guidelines.
o If you are engaging in the above type of communication, we suggest using the following: “I am a
Company Teammate. The opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent
the views of the Company and have not been authorized or adopted by the Company.” It is
important to note that a communication otherwise in violation of this or other Company policy is
not exempt from Company policy by including such a disclaimer.
Do not unlawfully use the Company’s logo, trademark, or proprietary graphics for commercial or
competitive purposes.

Report Platform and Community Abuse
If you believe that a topic or post violates our community guidelines—or if you have questions about whether
something is allowed—please contact the Corporate Communications team immediately at
socialmedia@advantagesolutions.net. You may also forward this information to your supervisor/manager or to
Human Resources by calling (888)-900-4276 or submitting a ticket via ServiceNow. Teammates may also submit a
report via the Ethics Hotline or call 888-325-7882, so the matter can be reviewed and appropriate action taken.
In response to a report of abuse or as part of our other review processes, we may review content on our platforms
and/or forums and take action if we determine there is a policy violation. That action may include restricting
access to the content, removing the content and limiting or terminating a user’s access to Advantage Solutions’
online forums in an appropriate capacity.
We reserve the right to change these guidelines at any point in our effort to keep our online platforms and
communities user-friendly, informative and safe. Again, we may limit or restrict your participation in these online
spaces at our discretion. These social media guidelines apply to all Advantage Solutions social media channels in
all languages available.
Teammates will be held accountable for engaging in social media activity that violates this policy. Failure to comply
with this policy may lead to discipline, up to and including termination of employment and, if appropriate, the
Company will pursue all available legal remedies. The Company also may report suspected unlawful conduct to
appropriate law enforcement authorities. The Company will not construe or apply this policy in a manner that
interferes with Teammate’s legally protected social media discussions regarding wages, hours or working
conditions. If you have any questions regarding this policy, contact your supervisor/manager or Human Resources.

SAFETY AND SECURITY
Page 47 of 48

Revised February 2025

Workplace Safety
The health and safety of Teammates and others on Company property are of critical concern to the Company. The
Company intends to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business as we strive to attain the
highest possible level of safety in all activities and operations.
The Company relies on our Teammates to help ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous
conditions. Teammates should carefully observe their work areas and immediately report any unsafe conditions
or potential hazards to their supervisor/manager. Additionally, any workplace injury, accident or illness must be
reported to a supervisor/manager immediately, regardless of the severity.
The Company has developed a written Injury and Illness Prevention Program in support of workplace health and
safety. This program can be found in the Safety and Workers’ Compensation section on the Company intranet.
Teammates must observe the Injury and Illness Prevention Program provisions, as well as all health and safety
guidelines related to their position, as strict compliance is required of all Teammates.

Workplace Violence Prevention 2
The safety and security of Teammates is of vital importance to the Company. Therefore, the Company has adopted
a zero-tolerance policy concerning workplace violence. Threats or acts of violence that involve or affect company
Teammates or that occur on the Company’s premises, will not be tolerated.
The prohibition against threats and acts of violence applies to all persons involved in the operation of the
Company, including, but not limited to, Company Teammates and other personnel, contract and temporary
workers, consultants, contractors, customers, vendors, visitors and anyone else on the Company’s premises.
Violations of this policy by a Teammate will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
employment.
It is our goal to have a workplace free from acts or threats of violence and to respond effectively in the event such
acts or threats of violence do occur.
Workplace violence is any conduct that occurs in or affects the workplace and is sufficient to cause an individual
to reasonably fear for their personal safety or the safety of their family, friends and/or property. Violence includes,
but is not limited to, threatening and intimidating behaviors, verbal comments, physical abuse, use or threatened
use of weapons of any kind, including but not limited to guns, knives, mace, pepper spray, bringing any type of
weapon onto Company property, vandalism, arson, sabotage or any other act that is deemed by management to
be inappropriate in this regard.
Examples of workplace violence include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•

2

Threats or acts of violence occurring on Company premises, regardless of the relationship between the
parties involved in the incident;
Threats or acts of violence occurring off Company premises involving someone who is acting in the
capacity of a representative of the Company;
Threats or acts of violence occurring off Company premises involving a Teammate if the threats or acts
affect the business interests of the Company;
All threats or acts of violence occurring off Company premises, of which a Teammate is a victim, if the
Company determines that the incident may lead to an incident of violence on Company premises; and

Teammates who work in California and New York are subject to the Workplace Violence Prevention Plan.
Page 48 of 49

Revised February 2025

•

Threats or acts of violence resulting in the conviction of a Teammate or agent of the Company, or an
individual performing services for the Company on a contract or temporary basis, under any criminal code
provision relating to violence or threats of violence when that act or the conviction adversely affects the
legitimate business interests of the Company.

Examples of conduct that may be considered threats or acts of violence under this policy include, but are not
limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Threatening physical contact directed toward another individual;
Threatening an individual or their family, friends, associates or property with harm;
The intentional destruction or threat of destruction of the Company’s or another's property;
Menacing or threatening phone calls;
Stalking;
Veiled threats of physical harm or similar intimidation; and/or
Communicating an endorsement of the inappropriate use of firearms or weapons.

Workplace violence does not refer to workplace arguments or debates that are zealous or impassioned, provided
there is no resort to any form of coercion. Discussions about sporting activities, popular entertainment or current
events are not considered workplace violence when there is no threat of violence being directed to the workplace
or any individual connected with it. Rather, workplace violence refers to behavior that demonstrates an intention
to engage in violence, condones violence in the workplace, or targets any individual with acts or threats of
violence.
Teammates should help maintain a violence-free workplace. To that end, Teammates are encouraged to
immediately report any incident that violates this policy to a supervisor or manager or Human Resources.
No provision of this policy statement or any other provision in this policy alters the at-will nature of employment
with the Company, unless applicable state law provides otherwise.
The Company will not tolerate retaliation against any Teammate who reports workplace violence.
Any Teammate who violates this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action, up to and including
termination. If the violent behavior is that of a non-Teammate, the Company will take appropriate corrective
action in an attempt to ensure that such behavior is not repeated.
The Company will make the sole determination of whether and to what extent, threats or acts of violence will be
acted upon by the Company. In making this determination the Company may undertake a case-by-case analysis
in order to ascertain whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that workplace violence has occurred.

Foodborne Illness for Teammates Handling Food
It is the intent of the Company to foster Teammate and public health and wellness and maintain compliance with
all federal, state and local laws on the prevention of foodborne illness. As such, the Company requires Teammates
whose job duties include handling food, to act in accordance with the following procedures:
• Teammates must inform their supervisor/manager when they have symptoms of an illness that can be
spread through food handling. Symptoms which must be reported include but are not limited to diarrhea,
vomiting, fever, sore throat with fever, etc.
• Teammates must inform their supervisor/manager if they are diagnosed with, have been exposed to, or
are the suspected source of a confirmed outbreak of any disease transmittable through food. This includes
the symptoms and conditions identified and posted on the websites for the U.S. Department of Health
Page 49 of 50

Revised February 2025

and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
Teammates must notify their supervisor/manager of any of the above conditions prior to reporting to work or, if
already at work, immediately following their knowledge of symptoms, diagnosis, or exposure. The
supervisor/manager will promptly determine whether to restrict or exclude the Teammate from handling food.
Teammates restricted or excluded from handling food may be placed in a temporary, alternative assignment, may
use accrued time off, or may apply for a leave of absence or other accommodation.
To return to work in a position requiring the handling of food, Teammates having had a confirmed diagnosis or
suspected exposure to any of the highly infectious conditions mentioned above, must provide their
supervisor/manager with a letter from a medical provider clearing them for return to work as a food handler, with
or without an accommodation. Medical information pertaining to a Teammate will be kept strictly confidential
and will be maintained in a separate medical file maintained by the Workplace Accommodations and Leave of
Absence teams. For additional information and/or to request an accommodation, Teammates should visit
Advantage Benefits at AdvantageBenefits.net.

Occupational Injury and Illness
The Company seeks to reduce occupational injuries and illnesses through its focus on workplace safety. Through
a variety of proactive measures, the Company:
•
•
•

Seeks to prevent accidents and other situations that may lead to workplace injuries or illnesses.
Fosters efficient case management of filed claims.
Endeavors to return Teammates to work as soon as possible where they are able to do so.

Occupational accidents, injuries and/or illnesses, no matter how minor, must be reported by the Teammate to
their supervisor or other member of management within 24 hours of the incident. In addition, within 72 hours of
the reported injury or illness, the Teammate’s supervisor/manager must promptly complete an “Incident
Investigation Report Form.” Reporting information is located on the Safety and Workers’ Compensation page on
the Company intranet.
Teammates are encouraged to review the Company’s Time Away policies to better understand what other types
of paid time away may be provided as a matter of Company policy (e.g., vacation, sick time and floating holidays)
and/or leaves of absence (under federal or state law or Company policy) that may concurrently apply to any
absence due to a workplace injury or illness.
The Company is committed to working together with its Teammates to enable those who have incurred a
workplace injury or illness to return to work in their previous position. Subject to business needs, applicable law
and any restrictions the Teammate may have, the Company may place a Teammate in an alternative position upon
return to work. If a Teammate is unable to perform their previous job or an alternative job, with or without an
accommodation, the Teammate’s employment may be subject to termination, as permitted by applicable law.
Teammates who believe they may need an accommodation to perform their job duties following a workplace
injury/illness are encouraged to access the Workplace Accommodations section on Advantage Benefits at
AdvantageBenefits.net to learn more about the process for requesting a reasonable accommodation and to
submit a request for review.

Solicitation / Distribution
No Teammate may engage in solicitation activities during their working time or during the working time of the
Teammate at whom such activity is directed.
Page 50 of 51

Revised February 2025

No Teammate shall distribute or circulate any non-work written or printed material in work areas at any time, or
during their working time or during the working time of the Teammate(s) at whom such activity is directed.
Teammates may distribute or circulate any written or printed material only in non-work areas, during non-working
times.
Under no circumstances will non-Teammates be permitted to solicit or to distribute written material for any
purpose on Company property.
Teammates should not use Company property to make, distribute, or circulate solicitation. This includes, but is
not limited to, Company networks, email addresses, Teams’ accounts, computers, phones, etc.
As used in this policy, "working time" includes all time for which a Teammate is paid and/or is scheduled to be
performing work for the Company. It does not include break periods, meal periods, or periods in which a
Teammate is not performing services or work for the Company.

Parking
Parking is generally available at each workplace in areas designated for Company parking. The Company will not
reimburse Teammates for parking tickets. The Company will not be liable for fire, theft, damage, or personal injury
involving Teammates’ vehicles or their contents. Teammates are advised to always lock their vehicle doors.

Visitors in The Workplace
To provide for the safety and security of Teammates and the facilities of the Company, only authorized visitors
are allowed in the workplace. All visitors must enter Company facilities at the reception area and sign-in as
directed. Authorized visitors will receive directions or be escorted to their destination. Teammates are responsible
for the conduct and safety of their visitors.
If an unauthorized individual is observed on the Company’s premises, Teammates should immediately notify their
direct supervisor/manager or, if necessary, guide the individual to the reception area.

Smoke-free Workplace
In keeping with the Company's intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment and in compliance with
applicable federal and state laws, smoking is prohibited throughout the workplace, within a reasonable distance
from outside entrances and in Company vehicles. The policy applies to all Teammates, clients, customers,
consultants and visitors.
Smoking includes any kind of tobacco use, vaping and/or e-cigarettes. There are no exceptions to this policy.
Smoking is only permitted during break times and only in designated areas outside Company buildings.
Teammates using these areas are expected to dispose of any smoking debris safely and properly.
Teammates found in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. Teammates who observe other
individuals smoking in the workplace have a right to object and should report the violation to their
supervisor/manager. No Teammate will be disciplined or retaliated against for reporting smoking that violates the
law or Company policy.

Page 51 of 52

Revised February 2025

Hazardous and Toxic Materials
If your job requires that you use hazardous and/or toxic materials, you are expected to comply with all applicable
laws, rules and regulations concerning their safe handling and disposal. If you have any questions about the
materials you work with or the proper safety procedures to follow, please discuss them with your manager before
handling the materials.

Inclement Weather / Office Closure
At times, emergencies such as severe weather, fires, power failures or earthquakes, can disrupt Company
operations. In extreme cases, these circumstances may require the closing of a work facility or a field-based
Teammate’s work territory. Management will determine if the office or territory will be closed.
When hazardous conditions or severe weather occurs during the day, the senior leader or management within
the location will decide whether to close early. In the event the Company closes early due to hazardous or severe
weather, non-exempt Teammates will be paid for hours worked only and will otherwise be paid in accordance
with applicable federal and state law.
When operations are officially closed due to emergency conditions, the time off from scheduled work will be paid,
up to a maximum of three days in any calendar year, subject to executive leadership approval.
When the Company is open, but a Teammate is unable to report to work because of hazardous or severe weather,
the Teammate should report any delay or absence to their supervisor/manager at the earliest possible time.
Teammates will be required to use accrued vacation time on days when the Company is open, but the Teammate
does not report to work because of inclement weather. For Teammates that do not have vacation available, nonexempt Teammates will be paid only for time worked and exempt Teammates will not be paid for full-day
absences due to inclement weather. If the office remains open, Teammates must make a reasonable effort to
report to work as scheduled. Teammates should not take unnecessary risks to report to work in unsafe conditions.

Technology Policy
The purpose of this policy is to address computer, email and internet use by Teammates of the Company and to
provide guidelines for the proper use of Company computer network and communications systems.
•

•

•

The Company provides Teammates with access to its computer system and networks primarily for use in
conducting Company business. By using the Company's network and computer systems, Teammates are
providing their consent to having their activity and Company-provided email and accounts accessed,
monitored, reviewed, recorded and stored without notice. Thus, at no time should employees believe
that they have any expectation of privacy while using any of the Company’s network and computer
systems.
All computers, computer networks and systems provided by the Company are the property of the
Company. Teammates should not assume emails sent from their Company provided email address are
confidential or private, even when a password is used to access the account or the term “confidential”
appears in the subject line. The Company may access the computer network and systems and review
communications within the system for any purpose the Company deems appropriate, with or without
providing prior notice to the Teammate. The Company will not monitor Teammates for any unlawful
purpose or in a manner that chills the rights of statutory Teammates to engage in activity protected by
Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
The use of the internet, email, or any other electronic resource to send, save, access or view obscene,
harassing, discriminatory, violent or threatening material is strictly prohibited by the Company. Prohibited
material includes, but is not limited to, sexual comments, jokes or images, racial slurs, gender-specific
Page 52 of 53

•
•

•

comments or any comments, jokes or images that would offend someone based on race, color, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, age, national origin or ancestry, disability, or any other characteristic
protected by applicable law.
Teammates’ use of email and the internet should be primarily limited to Company business during working
time. However, the Company does not prohibit Teammates from using their work email system for nonbusiness purposes when they are not on working time, such as during breaks. Every site visited can
determine the identity of the visitor. For this reason, Teammates should exercise sound judgment and
discretion when accessing the internet.
Teammates should be thoughtful and professional in all their communications and dealings with others
on the telephone, email and social media. Teammates should not harass, threaten, libel or defame fellow
professionals, Teammates, clients, competitors or anyone else using Company computer resources.
Computer viruses reside on the internet. Teammates should not download unauthorized software,
programs or materials without the prior approval of the Information Systems & Technology department.
Teammates should not open email attachments from recipients they do not recognize. Even if the
Teammate knows the sender, Teammates should not open any attachments that are not referred to in
the email or have atypical names, as it may have been transmitted maliciously.
If a Teammate believes that their computer has been affected by a virus, the Teammate should contact
the Information Systems & Technology department immediately.
Teammates should not share their computer passwords with anyone outside of the Information Systems
& Technology department as this could allow non-Teammates to access the Company's sensitive
information.
The Company's electronic communications are the property of the Company. The Company may store
electronic communications for a period of time after the communication is created. Communications may
be stored in the system, deleted, printed or otherwise used for any purpose. Teammates should delete
emails on a regular basis, unless instructed otherwise. The Company will purge emails that have not been
archived according to the schedule established by the Information Systems & Technology department.
Company systems shall not be used to send or receive copyrighted materials, software, trade secrets,
proprietary information, or similar materials without proper authorization. This includes (but is not limited
to) clips, photos, movies and music.
The Company's electronic resources must not be used for solicitation purposes during working time. The
Company's non-solicitation rule applies to the use of electronic resources.
This policy in no way prohibits Teammate communications that are protected under applicable state and
federal laws, including but not limited to any activity that is protected under Section 7 of the National
Labor Relations Act, which includes the right of Teammates to speak with others about their wages and
other terms and conditions of employment.

Prior to or upon separation of employment, no Teammate shall print, forward, transmit or remove any
information whatsoever from the Company’s Computer Systems, without written permission from management.
Also, upon separation of employment, all Company-provided phones, computers and other equipment must be
returned. Once the device is returned to IT, all data on the device will be erased. Teammates are not permitted
to forward to themselves or otherwise save or print any the Company data, including emails, business contacts,
customer lists, or other information. If you do not return the device to the IT Department prior to leaving on your
last day, the Company reserves the right to electronically “cleanse” your mobile device, which will remove all data
from the phone. Failure to return the device when required to do so may have additional legal consequences.
Failure to comply with all aspects of this policy may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment. For clarification, additional details or further information on this policy, contact your
supervisor/manager, Human Resources or the Information Systems & Technology department page located on
the Company intranet.

Use of Mobile Phones and Devices While Driving
Teammates who drive for business reasons and use a Company or personal mobile telephone or device, are
expected to put safety first. Therefore, for your safety, the safety of others and for the safeguarding of Company
property, Teammates are not to use Company or personal mobile telephones or devices while driving for Company
business. This includes all mobile telephone and device functionalities including talking, texting, retrieving or
viewing messages, emails or data. If you need to use a mobile telephone or device at a time when you are driving,
you must do so when you reach your destination, or pull over and safely and legally park before using the mobile
telephone or device. Teammates may use a hands-free mobile device while driving where applicable state or local
law has a hands-free driving law in place. In such situations, Teammates must adhere to the requirements of such
laws.
Teammates who are charged with traffic violations, or cause accidents or injuries, resulting from their use of
personal or Company mobile telephones or personal devices while driving for business will be solely responsible
for all liabilities and fines that result from such actions to the extent permissible under applicable law and may be
subject to discipline, up to and including termination from employment.
Teammates whose job responsibilities do not specifically include driving as an essential function, but who are
issued a Company-provided mobile telephone for business use or who use their personal mobile telephone for
business use, are also expected to abide by the provisions of this policy.

Unauthorized Recordings
The Company recognizes the need to comply with state law and to protect its confidential, proprietary information
from unauthorized disclosure while also avoiding deceptive practices that do not promote honest, ethical
standards of business conduct. As such, the Company prohibits the unauthorized or secret recording in any
restrooms or changing areas and/or when confidential, proprietary, trade secrets or personal information
belonging to the Company or its Teammates, customers or clients is being discussed or revealed.
Teammates are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws regarding recording, including
laws pertaining to two-party consent where applicable.
This policy is not intended and should not be construed to interfere, infringe, or restrain Teammate rights
protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act or by any applicable federal and state whistle-blowing
and wiretapping laws.

Clean Workspace
All Teammates are expected to keep their work areas clean and organized. Common areas such as lunch rooms,
locker rooms and restrooms should be kept clean by those using them. As a common courtesy to others, please
clean up after meals and dispose of trash properly.
