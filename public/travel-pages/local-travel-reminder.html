LOCAL TRAVEL & REPORTING
*Friendly Bulletin*
Local travel means that you are 6 hours or less from your home address to the project. In
most cases, this means you are responsible for DRIVING yourself to the project. You are
solely responsible for getting yourself to/from the project.
If you are more than 90 miles away, you will be provided with a hotel.
Drive time and mileage will be paid as per company travel policy (refer to the 2026 SAS
WFM Remodel Travel Team document regularly shared for more info)
GAS is not a reimbursable expense when you are in yours or anyone else’s PERSONAL
vehicle. Gas is only an approved expense when you are in an assigned RENTAL car.

DRIVE TRAVEL REPORTING
You will NOT have a separate travel shift as you do when you fly travel. Your drive time and
mileage (as applies) will be automatically calculated on your first work shift and final work
shift. NOTHING TO DO ON YOUR END! Do not report your first or last shift early as it’s not
necessary and messes up regular reporting!

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Mgmt.
