Catching Your Flight – Step by Step

Updated 6/2/25

Flying for the first time can be nerve racking and scary. Not knowing what to do, or where to go
and worrying about missing your flight can be stressful. Hopefully, this guide will help ease the anxiety
you are feeling and help you navigate the flight process and become a worry-free traveler.
YOU MUST HAVE A VALID (NOT EXPIRED) ID (NO PAPER COPY) or PASSPORT TO TRAVEL – NO EXCEPTIONS!!

Step 1: After you receive your flight information from your supervisor it is important that you verify
the information (i.e.: the departing airport is correct; the dates match the rest of your travel – hotel
and schedule sent out; your name is spelled correctly) If anything is incorrect, notify your supervisor
immediately. If you need to get a ride to the airport, this would be the time to start making
those arrangements. You will need to be at the airport 1.5 hours before your boarding time. YOU are
responsible for getting to the airport and missing your flight because you do not have a ride is NOT
an acceptable excuse.

Step 2: You will need to “check in” to your flight 24 hours before. When you receive your flight info
you should go to the airline’s website or download the FREE app for that airline. (We use Delta,
America and Southwest depending on where you fly from and what airlines fly from your home
airport). Once you are on the website you will need the confirmation # for your flight. Here are some
Examples:

Once on the website or app, you will find “Check in,”. 24 hours before your flight
you will check in by entering your confirmation number and name. Some airlines will assign
your seat when you check in and some will do it when you get to the airport.

Step 3: Day before your flight:
The day before your flight, make sure you have everything you need packed and ready to go.
Make sure you go to the airline’s website and look up what is NOT allowed in baggage, so you do
not pack anything that is not allowed. (there are size limits for certain items like shampoo, etc.)
Don’t forget to make sure you have your VALID photo ID, phone chargers, etc. You are generally
allowed 1 checked bag and 1 carry- on bag. Southwest charges for checked bags $35 to $45) unless you
are an A -Lister.
Delta and American charge for checked bags. (Generally, $35-$45 for the first bag and it varies per
airline after that) SAS only reimburses for 1 checked bag <MUST HAVE RECEIPT – Send Photo to your
Supervisor ASAP (no later than 24 hours)>, so it is best to pack light. There is a weight limit on checked
Bags (50lbs) so make sure you do not overpack your bag.

If you are DRIVING & NEED to park, locate Parking BEFORE you head to the airport. Know where you
are going. Know if you need to PRE-pay or pay when you return. Keep parking UNDER $15/day. Parking
expense can be reimbursed <MUST HAVE RECEIPT – Send Photo to your Supervisor ASAP (no later
than 24 hours)>.

Step 4: Let’s go to the Airport!!
Once you arrive at the airport, you should be there 1.5 hours prior to BOARDING TIME (you get paid
for this time) so you will have time to check your bag and get thru security. When you arrive, you will
find the counter for the airline you are flying on (there may be kiosks that you can use to print your bag
tags and boarding passes). At this point, if you need help, there is generally someone there from the
airline to help you.
After you get your bag tags and boarding pass(es) you will go to the counter and they will weigh
your bag and take it to put on the plane. They will also tell you what gate your flight will leave from.
Next stop, Security Checkpoint!!! Follow Airport Signs Usually State ALL GATES THIS WAY (or similar)
When you go thru security, make sure you have your ID and boarding pass ready to show TSA.
There will be TSA agents there to let you know what to do.
Step 5: Heading to your Gate
Once you get through the security checkpoint, you will make your way to the gate that is listed
on your boarding pass. There are also information boards pretty much everywhere throughout
the airport so you should check them periodically to make sure your gate has not changed. You can
check the board using different info. For example, you can look up your flight by the airport you are
flying to, the time of your flight and/ or your flight number. All this info can be found on your boarding
pass. It is best to verify that you are at the correct gate once you get there. Each gate has the flight
number and the destination shown on a screen behind the desk at the gate. If your flight is not on the
screen, you will need to either ask someone at the desk what gate your flight leaves from or check one
of the info boards. Also, pay attention to announcements that are made because if your gate is changed,
they will announce it over the intercom system.
Connecting flights and layovers – you may have a flight that takes you to a city between your home
airport and your final destination, this is called a connecting flight with a layover. The duration of your
layover will vary with each time you travel. Sometimes you will not have much time between the time
you arrive at the connecting airport and the time your next flight leaves from there to your final

destination. We suggest NOT leaving the airport when you have a layover to avoid missing the next
flight.
Let’s use the following flight to explain this. You are flying from Orlando to Chicago
with a layover in Atlanta.
**Your flight leaves Orlando, FL at 6am and lands in Atlanta at 8am
You leave Atlanta at 9:30am and arrive in Chicago at 11:30am
With this flight, you would arrive at Orlando airport at 4am and get your bag tags and boarding passes,
check your bag and head to the security checkpoint. Once you get through security, you head to your
gate. Typically, airlines START BOARDING 30 minutes prior to Flight Time! Once at the gate, make sure
your flight is listed on the screen behind the counter at the gate.
Pay attention to the announcements to make sure your gate doesn’t change as well as periodically
check the screen at the gate. You board the plane and off you go to Atlanta. Now is the time for you to
look at how long your layover in Atlanta will be so you know how much time you have to get to the
next gate when you arrive in Atlanta.
Once you arrive in Atlanta, you need to know what gate your next flight leaves from. You can ask the
airline representatives at the gate when you get off the plane and/or check the closest information
board to get this information. The representative can also point you in the right direction to your next
gate. Off you go to your next gate!! You may have to hustle; sometimes you do not have much time.
With the flight we are using as an example though, you have an hour and a half before your next flight
leaves. But be aware that you MUST be at the gate at least 30 min before the flight leaves since everyone
must board the flight before it can leave. Boarding generally starts 30 min before the flight leaves. Once
you get to your next gate and verify it is the correct gate, you can relax until it is time to board. When they
call for boarding, you are in the home stretch. Board the plane and off you go to Chicago!!

Step 6: Arriving at your Destination
Once you arrive at your final destination, you will need to retrieve your baggage. Follow the signs in the
Terminal to Baggage Claim. When you get to baggage claim each one will be numbered and will list
the flight on a screen. Find the one with your flight listed and wait for your baggage. Just as a side note,
before you get off the plane, they usually announce what baggage claim you need to go to but most
of the time with all the commotion of people getting up and getting ready to get off the plane, you can’t

hear the announcement. But you can ask the flight attendant as you leave the plane if you want.
After you get your baggage, follow the signs to the rental car facility to meet up with the rest of the team.
A few days prior to your flight will get a carpool email to let you know who you are riding with to get to the
hotel. If you don’t have that information by 2pm Friday before, please reach out to you supervisor or Elite.

Do not wait until travel day to ask.
NOTE: If your flight is delayed, you MUST email screenshots/photos of flight board or delay
In app your Lead AND your Supervisor & Patricia Booker immediately so that
arrangements can be made to get you from the airport to the hotel and so that there is no
questions about your travel time. Please do not wait until you get to your destination to
communicate that you flight is delayed. Help us ensure everyone is looped in sooner than later.
Missed flights are UNACCEPTABLE. This is why you are required to be at the airport 1.5 hours
prior to boarding time. IF you miss your flight, you MUST CALL your Supervisor immediately. Most,
(NOT ALL) airlines give you 2 hours to get to the airport to see if they can rebook you on another
flight. You MUST go to the airline counter to inquire about getting on the next flight to your
destination. THIS MUST NOT HAVE AN EXTRA FEE and WE WILL NOT REBOOK A FLIGHT FOR YOU.
If the airline cannot rebook you on anther flight with no charge, you CALL your supervisor
immediately. Missing your flight and not being able to get on another one, could result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Reporting Travel time: It is YOUR responsibility to report your travel time AS SOON AS YOU ARRIVE TO
YOUR HOTEL (going to project) or Transportation (going home)! Allowing yourself to arrive to the airport 1.5
hours PRIOR to your boarding time, your travel starts when you arrive to the airport 1.5 hours prior to
boarding time, until you arrive to your hotel (going to project) or you arrive to your transportation (going
home) without detours. If you miss your flight at no fault of the airlines, you will NOT be paid for the
additional travel involved. You will be paid your ORIGINAL travel time. Example if your flight is at 8am
(boarding time 7:30am), you are required to be there at 6am. Your travel time STARTS at 6am.. You are
scheduled to arrive at your destination airport at 2:30pm and your commute to your hotel is 1 hour.. That
means you should be submitting your travel time between 3:30pm/4:00pm (this should be your first
priority).. If YOU MISS YOUR FLIGHT and are put on the next flight at 11:00am and are now scheduled to
arrive to your destination at 8pm (YOU DO NOT GET PAID UNTIL 8pm).. You are allowed to submit your
ORIGINAL travel time from 6am – 3:30pm ONLY. However, keep in mind, not getting on that next flight
could result in a missed flight corrective action which could result in disciplinary action up to termination.
Direct quote from SAS Travel Policy: “Time, mileage and other expenses due to associate missed flights are
not reimbursable”

Your travel time in the correct format needs to be emailed to the PROJECT lead and PROJECT Elite &
Supervisor on copy on the SAME email so that EVERYONE is on the same page. (All this info is specified on
the project details email sent out prior to travel)
