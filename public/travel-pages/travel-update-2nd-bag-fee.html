TRAVEL UPDATE
(Effective Feb 5th, 2023)

Valid with EXTENDED TRAVEL ONLY. Starting February 5th, 2023 for those traveling airlines we will
approve a 2nd regular weight checked back for any projects that are 2 WEEKS OR MORE!
Baggage claim tickets are NOT valid receipts and will NOT be approved. This expense will not be
approved WITHOUT a VALID receipt that shows DATE, NAME & PRICE.
Overweight or oversized bags will NOT be approved
Some baggage fees are $30, others are $35 and in rare cases they are $40 per bag.

This does NOT apply for trip that are less than 2 weeks, where you will only be able to expense 1
checked bag as previously outlined.

We are hoping this helps with some of your out-of-pocket expenses.

SAFE TRAVELS!
