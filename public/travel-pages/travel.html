TRAVEL
Earn the Rewards: Sign up for airlines FREE rewards programs: Southwest, United, Delta, American
Airlines. You earn Free Airline Miles with every ticket used. Take advantage of this.. ðŸ˜Š
Travel time = If you live 60 minutes/40 miles OR LESS from the airport, you will NOT receive drive time/mileage
to/from airport from/to home. If you live MORE THAN 60 minutes/40 miles from the airport, drive
time/mileage (as per state law) will be automatically calculated. You will get paid travel time starting 1.5 hrs.
from the BOARDING TIME on your assigned flight. EXAMPLE: If your flight is at 7:15am, you are required and
get paid to be there at 5:15am. So, plan accordingly and note we will not pay you to get there any earlier
(unless PRE-approved). The only flight delays that will result in paid travel are delays that are BEYOND your
control (postponed/cancelled flights at fault of the airline or due to weather are most common circumstances
BEYOND your control). Not arriving 1.5 hours prior to boarding time would not fall into this category.
Our travel specialist (Patricia Booker) does NOT report time or load expenses, she only books and sends out
travel and deal with hotels, cars, flights BUT does not have authorization to change travel without a managers
approval.
You report TRUE time. Meaning if you start at 4am in CA (itâ€™s still 4am) but you stop at 4pm in NY (its still 4pm)
(there is no need to try to figure out different time zones)
** YOU MUST REPORT YOUR OWN TIME USING YOUR PIN NUMBER**
FOR FLIGHT TRAVEL - IT IS IMPERATIVE that you SEND your travel time to the project specific lead
IMMEDIATELY when you arrive at your destination (this info is provided in the project details email).
It is YOUR responsibility to report yet also send in YOUR time to lead/supervisor.
Delays in reporting and sending in your time could result in delays in payroll = delays in payment.
Effective 8/5/2023; travel time MUST be submitted in THIS FORMAT to the designated reporting lead and elite:
Example ONLY:

KEY so you know what abbreviations stand for:

(PROJET CODE HERE) Travel

3 LETTER Project Specific Code (found on your project details email & all travel emails in subject line)

BT: 6:25am / FT: 6:55am

BT = Boarding Time (can be found on boarding pass) / FT = Flight Time (can be found on both flight details email & boarding pass)

TT: 4:55am â€“ 3:15pm
TT = TOTAL TRAVEL TIME ALLOWED/REPORTED (not duration) = UP TO 1.5 hrs. before boarding OR actual time arrived at airport â€“
Time arrived at hotel (TO project) or Time arrived to transportation (FROM project). We do not pay for your time if you have to wait on a ride, it is your responsibility
to have your transportation lined up nor does travel time include your drive from airport to home. We do NOT pay you to arrive earlier than 1 hour and 30 minute
before boarding
FLIGHTS ARE NOT PROVIDED IF A PROJECT IS 6 HOURS OR LESS (From Home Address ON FILE with Supervisor/Oracle) â€“ THESE ARE CONSIDERED DRIVABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES and YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING YOURSELF TO AND FROM.

If for ANY REASON, you have a delayed/cancelled/changes in flight (avoidable or not) it is CRUCIAL that you REPLY ALL to the Project
Need-to-know audience email with a screenshot of the delay and send your new flight info (new arrival time) AT THE TIME OF THE
DELAY not hours later. Others may be affected by your delayed flight, so please be courteous so we can communicate in a timely
manner to everyone affected. You will NOT be compensated for delayed flights unless properly communicated with
screenshots/photo or additional travel time associated with missed flights (even if you get on a later flight) as stated by the
company travel policy!

WE CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT MISSING YOUR FLIGHT. 9 TIMES OUT OF 10 OTHER PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED. PLAN ACCORDINGLY AND GET
TO THE AIRPORT 1.5 HOURS PRIOR TO YOUR FLIGHT BOARDING TIME SPECIFIED ON YOUR FLIGHT RESERVATION. NOT GETTING THERE 1.5 HOURS BEFORE FLIGHT
BOARDING TIME IS EQUIVILENT TO BEING LATE TO A SCHEULED SHIFT AS YOU GET PAID FOR THIS TIME!

REAL ID: Beginning May 7, 2025, TSA will require every Passenger to present a state-issued REAL
ID compliant license or identification card, or another acceptable form of ID (such as a U.S.
Passport), to fly within the United States.

Please be aware of the following guidelines:
It is your responsibility to check all information sent to you the same day that you receive it. Please look for
any possible errors, spelling of your name, dates, location, etc. If you see any errors or problems, please
notify your Project Supervisor and Patricia Booker right away. Time is of the essence. Also 24 hours in
advance of your flight please do your boarding check-in with the airline. You cannot check in prior to 24 hours
in advance and you donâ€™t want to wait much longer after that. There is an app that you can download to your
phone for each airline that will make it easy to do. Once you check-in you will get a boarding pass and a
boarding number. Make sure to capture it to your phone or print. If you only capture it to your phone, make
sure to get one printed up when you arrive to the airport just in case your phone does not have connection
(better safe than sorry). If for some reason you canâ€™t do your boarding check in, notify your project supervisor
right away. Having access to the apps will also give you notifications of delayed or cancelled flight (which you
should always advise the Project Supervisor, Patricia, the Lead & Jayson of IMMEDIATELY with screenshots).
KNOW what is and is NOT allowed in Carryon Bags (check the airline website if you are not familiar with
flight travel)
DO NOT MISS YOUR FLIGHT!! Missed flights are costly, disruptive, and extremely timely to fix. Missed flights
and no show, no calls are not tolerated and are grounds for termination.

At no time are YOU allowed to change your travel that was booked and paid for by SAS Retail Services. If there are
circumstances that need to be discussed, then you need to contact the project Supervisor or Ops Manager. Changing
your flight is NOT ALLOWED PERIOD without PRIOR Approval. This is considered leaving the project or not showing up as
scheduled without authorization which can be deemed as Job Abandonment and result in disciplinary action up to
termination.

â€¢

If your flight is cancelled at no fault of your own, PLEASE CALL either the project Supervisor, Patricia Booker or
Ops Manager. An email after normal business hours or on the weekend may not be seen/answered in a timely
manner. This is something that we need to address IMMEDIATELY. If you email/text and donâ€™t get a responseâ€¦
next step is to CALLâ€¦

â€¢

If you are going to miss your flight, again PLEASE CALL either the project Supervisor, Patricia Booker or Ops
Manager PRIOR to the scheduled flight time so we can at least TRY to avoid total loss of funds, an email after
normal business hours or on the weekends may not be seen/answered in a timely manner.. If you email/text
and donâ€™t get a responseâ€¦ next step is to CALLâ€¦

â€¢

If there is an urgent matter, PLEASE CALL either the project Supervisor or Ops Manager ASAP, an email after
normal business hours or on the weekends may not be seen/answered in a timely manner. If you email/text and
donâ€™t get a responseâ€¦ next step is to CALLâ€¦

â€¢

If you know you are traveling, please DONâ€™T wait until last minute to follow-up if you are missing anything
(Flights, Hotels, Rentals for drivers, Carpool Details, etc.)â€¦ Everything for the following week should be sent out
by EOD Thursday each week. So, if you are missing anything FOLLOW-UP ON FRIDAY MORNING,
PLEASE. Emailing on Saturday night that you donâ€™t have your flight info is very inconvenient, and we may not be
where we can get it to you before a Sunday morning flight. Letâ€™s work together and be prepared
